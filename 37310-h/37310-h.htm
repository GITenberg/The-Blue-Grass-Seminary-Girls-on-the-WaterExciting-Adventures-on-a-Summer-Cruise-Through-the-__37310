<h1>THE BLUE GRASS SEMINARY GIRLS ON THE WATER.</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I.—PLANNING A TRIP.</h2>
<p>
“Dad, we want to take a trip.”
</p>
<p>
The speaker was Shirley Willing, a typical Kentucky
girl, slender of figure, vivacious of manner,
and extremely pretty. With her father, she stood
on the big, sunny front porch of the Willing farmhouse.
As she again was about to address her
father, a second young girl, who, it could be seen at
a glance, was of about Shirley’s years, joined them.
</p>
<p>
This was Mabel Ashton, Shirley’s particular
friend and life chum. Shirley greeted her with a
smile, and Mr. Willing’s face also wrinkled pleasantly.
</p>
<p>
“I was just telling Dad that we want to take a
trip this summer,” explained Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Mabel smiled.
</p>
<p>
“We have talked it all over,” she agreed, “and
we just want to go some place.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
</p>
<p>
“Where?” asked Mr. Willing briefly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, we—we—want to go to—to—where is it
we want to go, Shirley?” asked Mabel in some confusion.
</p>
<p>
“We hadn’t decided on that yet, Dad,” laughed
Shirley. “But we don’t want to stay here on this
old farm all summer.”
</p>
<p>
“And what are you going to do with both your
old Dads—leave them behind?” asked Mr. Willing
seriously.
</p>
<p>
“We would like to have you go with us, Dad, but
we know you won’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Why won’t we?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I—we,—I—you never have gone with
us.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s never too late to mend our ways,” declared
her father dryly. “Perhaps we shall this time.”
</p>
<p>
Both girls clapped their hands, and scampered
about the porch eagerly. At last Shirley stopped
her antics, and standing directly before her father,
took him by the coat with both hands.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean it, Dad?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Ashton and I have decided that the next
time you two youngsters go away from home we
are going with you. When you are by yourselves
you get into too much mischief. Now where is
it you want to go?”
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t the slightest idea,” was the reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing turned to Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“You call your father out here and we’ll talk
this thing over,” he told her.
</p>
<p>
Mabel hastened to obey, and while she is searching
for her father, we shall take time to introduce
Shirley Willing and Mabel Ashton more fully
to the reader.
</p>
<p>
The two girls had been friends ever since they
could remember. Born and raised within a few
doors of each other in the little town of Paris,
Bourbon county, Kentucky, they had been inseparable
companions from the time they were able
to walk. This friendship was strengthened by the
fact that their fathers had been bosom friends before
them.
</p>
<p>
While the girls were still young, Shirley’s mother
died, and a short time later Mr. Willing purchased
a large farm on the Bethlehem Pike, three miles
from town. It was less than a year later that
Mabel’s mother passed into the great Beyond, and
Mr. Ashton bought a farm adjoining that of his
old friend. And here they had lived ever since.
</p>
<p>
When Shirley reached the age of fourteen, she
conceived the idea of going away to school. Mabel
announced that she was going with her. The objections
of their fathers they soon overcame, and
at last found themselves installed as pupils of the
Bluegrass Seminary in Lexington. Here, because
of their kind-heartedness and their many good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
deeds, they were soon among the most popular girls
of the school.
</p>
<p>
Being athletically inclined, they were prominent
in all branches of girls’ sports. Their chief pleasure
was horseback riding, in which art there were
few more proficient. In fact, Shirley once had
saved her father’s fortune by carrying the Willing
colors to victory in the great Kentucky Derby, as
related in “The Bluegrass Seminary Girls on Vacation.”
</p>
<p>
Naturally modest, they nevertheless had been
made, soon after their arrival at the seminary,
members of the Glee Club, for it was found that
both possessed voices of rare excellence. During
the second Christmas vacation, with other members
of the Glee Club, they had toured the larger eastern
cities, and through entertainments had lifted a
large debt that threatened the end of the Seminary.
</p>
<p>
Both girls also possessed great courage, as they
had proved on more than one occasion, and they
had had many exciting adventures, one of the most
important of which was the settling of a mountain
feud in which they had faced great danger unflinchingly,
as related in “The Bluegrass Seminary Girls
on Motorcycles.”
</p>
<p>
The summer vacation now had just begun. Shirley
and Mabel had returned from Lexington two
days before this story opens. At the Willing place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
they found Mr. Ashton, who had been very ill for
some years, and had been making his home with
his friend while his daughter was away at school.
</p>
<p>
But now Mr. Ashton was greatly improved, as
Mabel found to her great joy. He was gaining
daily and recovering lost weight and strength.
</p>
<p>
Mabel, searching for her father in response to
Mr. Willing’s request, found him in the sitting
room. She went up to him and took him by the
hand.
</p>
<p>
“Come on Dad,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ashton—“colonel” he was always called by
his friends—allowed himself to be pulled toward
the door.
</p>
<p>
“What’s up?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Willing, Shirley and I want to have a talk
with you,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“H-mm-m,” muttered the colonel, “must be
something you two want. Have you succeeded in
twisting Willing around your fingers?”
</p>
<p>
“The idea, Dad!” exclaimed Mabel. “You know
neither Shirley nor I would think of trying to do a
thing like that.”
</p>
<p>
Colonel Ashton grinned.
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t you?” he asked dryly. “I’m not so
sure of that.”
</p>
<p>
Father and daughter made their way to the front
porch, where Shirley and her father were deep in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
conversation. Colonel Ashton dropped into a
chair, and Mabel sat down at his feet.
</p>
<p>
“Ashton,” said Mr. Willing, “these girls say they
want to go some place. What do you think about
it?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ashton was silent for some moments. He
did not seem to be surprised.
</p>
<p>
“Where do they want to go?” he asked at length.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t know, Dad,” said Mabel. “We just
want to take a trip.”
</p>
<p>
“And,” Shirley broke in, “my Dad says you and
he might come with us.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ashton looked at his old friend in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“You say that, Willing?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Colonel, I did. Why not, eh? You and
I are getting along in years and have earned a vacation.
I’m agreeable, if you are.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know but you are right,” was the slow
reply. “I guess I am well enough to travel. I’ll
go.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel jumped quickly to her feet, and hugged
him. Shirley performed a similar operation on her
father.
</p>
<p>
“Then,” said Mr. Willing, disengaging himself at
last, “the only question to be settled is, where shall
we go?”
</p>
<p>
“This is a pretty sizeable country, Willing,” said
the colonel, “I guess there are plenty of places to
go.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
“I had thought of Atlantic City,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“And what had you thought of?” demanded Mr.
Willing of Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” was the reply, “there were two things I
wanted to do, and I don’t know which I shall
choose.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s hear them,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“You know, Dad, ever since Mabel and I went
away with the Glee Club, we have both been anxious
to take a trip on one of the big ocean steamers.
That is one thing I would like to do.”
</p>
<p>
“And where would you like to go?”
</p>
<p>
“Any place. Across the ocean.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we won’t do that,” said Colonel Ashton.
“This European war makes it too risky. We
might be sunk by one of those German submarines.”
</p>
<p>
“Right, Colonel,” agreed Mr. Willing. He
turned again to Shirley, “and the other thing you
would like to do?” he questioned.
</p>
<p>
“I should like to go to the Panama Exposition
in San Francisco.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel jumped to her feet and clapped her hands.
</p>
<p>
“That’s where I should like to go, too,” she cried.
“Why didn’t I think of it before?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing considered.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” he said at length, “I don’t know why we
can’t do both of those things, Shirley.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
“But the ocean trip, Dad. Where would we
go?”
</p>
<p>
“To San Francisco,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“But, how—”
</p>
<p>
“You must remember that the Panama Canal is
open to traffic, daughter,” explained Mr. Willing.
“We can take a steamer from New York direct to
San Francisco. Besides, I should like to have a
look at the canal, with its great locks and other
interesting things. The construction of the canal
is considered one of the greatest of all feats of
engineering.”
</p>
<p>
Colonel Ashton nodded his head emphatically.
</p>
<p>
“I should like to take that trip myself,” he declared.
</p>
<p>
“Then we shall consider that matter settled,”
said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“And when can we start, dad?” asked Shirley
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we will not be able to leave here for a
week or ten days. I have some business affairs
that must be put in order before I can get away.
Besides, you two girls will want clothes and things,
and you can’t get those in a minute.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll go to town this afternoon and get some
things,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” laughed Mr. Willing, “but just the
same it will take you at least a week to get yourselves
ready. Then I shall have to make arrangements for our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
passage, find out when we leave New
York and attend to other details. It will take
time.”
</p>
<p>
“But we shall go as soon as possible, Dad?” asked
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” was the reply. “You may make sure of
that. We shall go as soon as possible. Hello—who’s
that?”
</p>
<p>
The others gazed in the direction of his pointing
finger. Through the pike gate, at that moment,
came a solitary horseman.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder who he is?” exclaimed Shirley.
</p>
<h2><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II.—AN ADDITION TO THE PARTY.</h2>
<p>
The horseman came closer.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Shirley gave an exclamation of delight.
She had recognized the visitor even at this distance,
which was too great for the others to perceive
his identity. Mabel looked at her chum in
astonishment.
</p>
<p>
“Dick!” cried Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Now Mabel understood, and even Mr. Willing
allowed a slight smile to steal across his face.
</p>
<p>
Shirley ran down the steps from the porch and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
hurried toward the distant yard gate. The girl and
the horseman arrived at about the same time, and
those on the porch saw the rider lift his cap and
dismount.
</p>
<p>
Then he led the horse through the gate, closed it
behind him and with the bridle in his hand continued
his way to the house afoot, Shirley walking
by his side.
</p>
<p>
“Dick!” cried Shirley again, as the rider dismounted
at the gate upon sight of her. “What
are you doing here? I am glad to see you.”
</p>
<p>
“I was in Paris on a little business,” replied the
young man, “and I thought I wouldn’t go away
without paying my respects to you and your
father.”
</p>
<p>
At the house Mr. Willing greeted the young man
warmly, for, from previous meetings, he had taken
a liking to Dick.
</p>
<p>
Dick Stanley was a native of Cincinnati, O. He
was without parents, and after having met Shirley
under exciting circumstances, he had given up a
rough set of companions and at length had obtained
a place as office boy on one of the big Louisville
newspapers. But Dick had not remained an office
boy long, and he was now one of the most competent
and best liked reporters on the paper.
</p>
<p>
He had been sent to Paris for a certain piece of
news—“on a story,” in his words, the words of the
newspaper world—and he had just completed his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
work successfully. Therefore he had hired a horse
and come to the Willing farm for a few words
with his friends before going back to Louisville.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad to see you, young man,” said Mr. Willing
in greeting. “It has been some time since we
have had the pleasure of your company.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir,” was the reply. “I am always
glad to be here.”
</p>
<p>
He shook hands with Mr. Ashton and Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Now Shirley proceeded to tell him of the trip
they were going to take, and Dick was greatly interested.
</p>
<p>
“I should like to see the canal,” he said. “I have
been reading quite a bit about it, and it is very interesting.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right, young man,” agreed Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“It is one of the wonders of the world.” He
paused, struck by a sudden idea. Then he said
slowly, looking squarely at Dick:
</p>
<p>
“How would you like to go with us?”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like it fine,” declared Dick, with a smile.
“I wish it could be done.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it can be done,” said Mr. Willing quietly.
</p>
<p>
Dick, as well as Shirley and Mabel, looked at
Mr. Willing in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Dad!” exclaimed Shirley. “What do you
mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Just what I say,” was the reply. “I am going
to take Dick with us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
Dick shook his head slowly.
</p>
<p>
“I appreciate your kindness, Mr. Willing,” he
said quietly, “but I cannot accept such generosity.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t, eh?” blustered Mr. Willing, “and why
not, I’d like to know. I am not in the habit of having
my invitations refused, sir!”
</p>
<p>
Again Dick smiled.
</p>
<p>
“It is very kind of you to ask me,” he said, “but
I do not feel that I should accept. Of course, I
have the money for the trip, but I do not feel I
can afford to spend it. Besides, I could not leave
the paper for so long a time.”
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t leave the paper!” echoed Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll speak a few words to my friend Col. Harperson,
the owner, and he will see that you are given
an indefinite vacation.”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir, thank you, I don’t think it can be
done.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you,” said Mr. Willing, trying a new
line, for he had made up his mind to have Dick
accompany them, “you will be able to do some writing
on the trip. The sights you will see should
mean money to you. You should be able to write
many interesting articles when you get back.”
</p>
<p>
Dick apparently was impressed with this line of
reasoning. And now Shirley added her voice to
the colonel’s.
</p>
<p>
“Please, come, Dick?” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the young man after hesitating a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
long while, “I’ll tell you what I’ll do. If I can
make arrangements to get off indefinitely, I’ll go.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley clapped her hands.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure you can,” she cried.
</p>
<p>
And Mr. Willing muttered to himself:
</p>
<p>
“I’ll fix it with Harperson!”
</p>
<p>
The discussion of the trip now became general,
and Dick was acquainted with the time they expected
to depart.
</p>
<p>
“You will remain here over night, of course,”
said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir, I shall be glad to.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we’ll put off our shopping till to-morrow,
Mabel,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
All day the three young people talked eagerly of
the coming trip, and Shirley tried to get Dick to
promise that he would go, whether he was able to
get off or not. But this Dick would not do.
</p>
<p>
“If they agree to let me off, all right,” was his
decision.
</p>
<p>
They sat up and talked till late that night, but
Mr. Willing finally put an end to this conversation.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley,” he said severely, “are you going to
keep that young man talking all night? How do
you expect him to catch the early train in the morning?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I would have gone any time he told me,”
pouted Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t suppose he would have told you if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
had kept him talking all night,” replied Mr. Willing
dryly.
</p>
<p>
Dick arose and bade the others good night. A
few moments later Shirley and Mabel retired to
their room, where they lay for a long time before
sleep overcame them, so excited were they at the
prospect of the great trip.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad Dick is going,” said Mabel, “but I
don’t suppose I am half as glad as you are.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” demanded Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, just because,” replied Mabel, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see anything to laugh at,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t? No, I guess you don’t. Do you
know, I’d give a whole lot if some nice boy like
Dick would come all this way to see me.”
</p>
<p>
“He came to see you as well as me,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Oh no he didn’t. If I had been the only girl
here, Dick would not have been on hand to-day.
Besides, if it wasn’t for you I’m sure he wouldn’t
even think of taking the trip to San Francisco.”
</p>
<p>
“But he wants to see something of the Panama
Canal.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! you didn’t use to be so dense,”
exclaimed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Dense?” repeated Shirley. “What do you
mean, Mabel?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right, keep it up,” exclaimed Mabel. “I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
won’t say anything more. Are you going into
town to-morrow?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I thought we would go in as soon as Dick
had gone.”
</p>
<p>
“That suits me. We’ll have to get a lot of
things.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say so. Why, I haven’t a single decent
thing to wear.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll put in a good supply, so we won’t have
to buy anything while we are away. My! but
won’t it be a nice trip?”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t it though. I can hardly wait for the
time to come.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor I. But let’s get some sleep or we won’t
want to get up in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
Both closed their eyes and tried to sleep. But
they had too much on their minds to go to sleep
immediately, and it was long minutes before drowsiness
overcame them and they lost themselves, only
to dream that they were sailing across the ocean.
</p>
<p>
The following morning they accompanied Dick
to Wright’s station, where he took a train for Lexington.
There he would have to change for Louisville.
</p>
<p>
“Let us know as soon as possible?” called Shirley,
as he climbed aboard.
</p>
<p>
“I will,” replied Dick. “I’ll write immediately
I have learned one thing or the other.”
</p>
<p>
The train moved away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel returned to the house, where
Mr. Willing was waiting for them with the automobile.
</p>
<p>
“Ashton and I have decided to do a little shopping
on our own hook,” he explained. “We want
to spruce up a bit. Daughter, do you suppose there
will be any nice-looking, middle-aged ladies aboard
the boat? If so, why Ashton and I—”
</p>
<p>
“Dad!” interrupted Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Well, all right. Of course if you object,” said
Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
All the rest of the day the girls put in shopping.
Dresses and frocks for all occasions they bought,
besides a couple of outing costumes.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how long it takes to get to San
Francisco from New York,” said Shirley, “so we
had best be prepared.”
</p>
<p>
But when the day was over they found they had
not completed their shopping, and would have to
return again on the morrow.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing, during the day, transacted his business
and found out the date of sailing from New
York. Taking it for granted that Dick would accompany
them, he purchased a ticket and made
accommodations for him as well as the others.
</p>
<p>
“How long shall we be gone, Dad?” asked Shirley,
as the automobile sped homeward.
</p>
<p>
“Well, let’s see. This is the fourth of June.
We shall leave New York on the fifteenth. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
should say we would be back by the middle of August.”
</p>
<p>
“And will we come back the same way?”
</p>
<p>
“No; we’ll come back by rail. One way by boat
will be enough. You’ll have seen plenty of water
by the time you reach San Francisco.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope Dick decides to go with us,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“And so do I,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’ll go, all right,” remarked Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
And the latter was right. Three days later Shirley
stood before her father with an open letter in
her hand.
</p>
<p>
“It’s from Dick,” she explained. “He says he is
going with us.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing chuckled.
</p>
<p>
“I see Harperson is still a friend of mine,” he
muttered to himself.
</p>
<h2><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III.—OFF FOR NEW YORK.</h2>
<p>
It was the morning of the twelfth of June that
the party of five went early to Paris to catch the
eight o’clock train for Cincinnati. Dick had arrived
the night before, and in spite of the fact that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
they would have to be up very early in the morning,
all sat up talking, for the young people were too excited
to go to sleep.
</p>
<p>
All through the long hours of the night the girls
tossed about, scarcely closing their eyes. They
were up with the break of day, which was soon
after four o’clock.
</p>
<p>
At last the time for departure came, and they
jumped gaily into the large automobile which was
to take them to town.
</p>
<p>
“What time shall we leave Cincinnati, sir?” Dick
asked of Mr. Willing, as the train pulled out from
the station.
</p>
<p>
“Twelve o’clock,” was the reply. “We’ll get
there a little after eleven, which will give us time
to get across town to the Pennsylvania station. I
have made reservations on the New York train.”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless it lacked only twenty minutes of
the noon hour when the train pulled into Cincinnati.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry girls,” ordered Mr. Willing. “We have
no time to lose. We can just about make it.”
</p>
<p>
They dashed through the station and out the
Third street entrance, where Mr. Willing immediately
engaged two taxicabs.
</p>
<p>
“Pennsylvania Station!” he ordered, and they
were off at a good gait.
</p>
<p>
Through the narrow streets congested with traffic
they were forced to go more slowly, and Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
Willing looked at his watch impatiently from time
to time.
</p>
<p>
“Seven minutes!” he said, and they were still
some distance from their destination, and then the
first cab stopped to let a car pass in front of it.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry!” commanded Mr. Willing of his driver.
“We haven’t got all day to get there. Let the
street cars do the waiting after this.”
</p>
<p>
The chauffeur nodded and the cab leaped forward,
scattering pedestrians right and left, darting
in and out among other vehicles, avoiding a
collision as though by a miracle. The second cab
came close behind.
</p>
<p>
At last the station was reached and all dismounted
hurriedly. With Mr. Willing in the lead
they ran through the station to the train shed.
Here the conductor had just called “All aboard!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing heard him, and urged the others on
faster. They passed through the gate, Mr. Willing
assisted the girls and Colonel Ashton up the steps,
then climbed up himself. And as he did so, Shirley,
who had turned to look at him, cried:
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Dick?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing looked around, then stood nonplussed.
Dick was not here. The train began to
move.
</p>
<p>
There came a shout from behind and a young
man came dashing after the train. Shirley cried
out in alarm. It was Dick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p>
The train had gathered headway now and was
slipping along beneath the shed more rapidly.
Dick sprinted, gained, clutched the handrail of the
car and swung himself aboard just as the train
gathered even greater speed.
</p>
<p>
He climbed to the platform, wiped the moisture
from his brow, fanned himself vigorously and then
smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Close call, that,” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Young man,” said Mr. Willing dryly, “hereafter
let there be no loitering behind. You gave
me a scare and I don’t care for any more of the
same.”
</p>
<p>
“Daddy!” exclaimed Shirley. “I am sure Dick
didn’t do it intentionally.”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir,” agreed Dick. “As I followed after
you I bumped into a lady and knocked her suitcase
from her hand. It came open and the contents
scattered about. For a moment I forgot all about
the train and stopped to help her pick them up.
Then I happened to remember we were late, and
ran after you.”
</p>
<p>
“Your gallantry is bound to get you in trouble
if you are not careful,” commented Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
They went inside.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing had engaged the two drawing rooms,
one at either end of the car. Dick and the two
older men were to occupy one and the two girls
the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
It was almost eight o’clock when the train pulled
into Pittsburgh. They had just finished dinner, so
Dick stepped off to look about for a few moments.
</p>
<p>
As he stood beside the steps of the Pullman, another
man, probably several years his senior, approached
and engaged him in conversation. He
was an agreeable sort of a chap. He spoke English
with the faintest of accents, however, and this
Dick was not slow to notice.
</p>
<p>
It appeared that the man had a berth on the same
car, and they climbed aboard together. In the
smoking compartment was Mr. Willing, to whom
Dick introduced the newcomer. Mr. Ashton came
in a few moments later, and all sat talking.
</p>
<p>
The stranger, who introduced himself as Henry
Bristow, made himself very agreeable and Mr.
Willing took an instant liking to him.
</p>
<p>
During the course of the conversation, Dick
chanced to mention that they would sail from New
York for San Francisco on the fifteenth.
</p>
<p>
“On what ship?” demanded Bristow eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Yucatan</em>,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Is that so?” exclaimed the other. “I shall sail
on the same vessel.”
</p>
<p>
“For San Francisco?” asked Dick in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“That all depends,” was the answer. “I shall
only take passage as far as Colon. Whether I shall
go further depends upon my—upon circumstances.”
</p>
<p>
“We shall be glad to have you as a fellow passenger,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
declared Mr. Willing. “As you are going to
be such, you must meet my daughter, and the
daughter of the colonel here.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall be pleased,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
He accompanied the others to the drawing room,
where introductions followed.
</p>
<p>
Young Bristow conversed fluently upon many
topics and the others were delighted with him.
From his remarks it was gathered that he had traveled
considerably.
</p>
<p>
He spoke familiarly of New York, Chicago, San
Francisco, and apparently had a personal knowledge
of London, Paris, Berlin and other European
cities. He was equally as well acquainted with the
larger southern cities.
</p>
<p>
The two girls were eager listeners to the tales
of his travels, and even Mr. Willing and Colonel
Ashton gave an attentive ear to these stories.
</p>
<p>
“And where do you live?” asked Mr. Willing suddenly.
“What did you say your business is?”
</p>
<p>
The young man’s face suddenly turned red.
</p>
<p>
“My home is in New York,” he replied quietly,
“and as for my business, I fear that must remain
a secret for the present.”
</p>
<p>
“Daddy, you shouldn’t be so inquisitive,” said
Shirley with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure I’m sorry,” apologized her father. “I
didn’t mean—”
</p>
<p>
“Say no more about it,” replied the young man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
with a pleasant smile. “For certain reasons, I am
not now able to reveal the nature of my business.”
</p>
<p>
Dick had been thinking rapidly. Suspicions had
entered his head, and he could not shake them off.
And still he knew that they would sound foolish
to another.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll keep them to myself,” he said, “but I’ll keep
an eye open.”
</p>
<p>
The train was just pulling into North Philadelphia
when Shirley and Mabel opened their eyes the
next morning. Mabel glanced at her watch.
</p>
<p>
“Seven o’clock,” she exclaimed. “We’ll have to
hurry, Shirley. You know these fast trains don’t
take long to reach New York from here. Besides,
we want to get breakfast on the train.”
</p>
<p>
They dressed as rapidly as possible, and emerged
from their drawing room just in time to see young
Bristow stride down the aisle.
</p>
<p>
He gave them a cheery “good morning” and
turned as Mr. Willing came up.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you will join us at breakfast, sir,” said
Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
The young man accepted, and as Dick and Colonel
Ashton appeared at this moment, all made
their way to the diner together.
</p>
<p>
“Where shall you stay in New York, sir?” asked
Bristow of Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“At the McAlpin,” was the reply. “We shall
spend the two days looking about the city, going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> a couple of hours before time
for her departure.”
</p>
<p>
Bristow turned to Dick.
</p>
<p>
“I shall look you up either this afternoon or to-morrow,
and we’ll take a stroll,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be glad to walk with you,” Dick replied.
</p>
<p>
Breakfast over, they returned to the Pullman,
where they began to get their things together, for
they were close to New York.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later the train plunged into the
tunnel under the Hudson river. Mr. Willing, who
had been to New York before, explained how the
tunnel had been constructed and gave other interesting
information.
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t think we were in a tunnel,” exclaimed
Shirley. “There is no smoke.”
</p>
<p>
“Electric engine,” replied Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“And we go right under the river?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” exclaimed Mabel. “Just to
think that there is a river running right over the
top of us. Suppose it would come through.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing smiled.
</p>
<p>
“It won’t,” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
And now the porter came for their baggage, and
carried it to the vestibule. The conductor poked
his head in the door and called out:
</p>
<p>
“New York!”
</p>
<p>
“Here we are,” exclaimed Shirley eagerly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
“The city I have always wanted to see. The greatest
city in the world!”
</p>
<h2><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV.—DICK HAS AN ADVENTURE.</h2>
<p>
The two days spent in New York City were
days of wonder to Shirley, Mabel and Dick. They
were on the go every minute of the time, sightseeing.
From one end of the city to the other they
travelled with wide-open eyes.
</p>
<p>
The great skyscrapers impressed them, perhaps,
more than any one other thing, though they saw
much to amaze them; and next to the great buildings
they were impressed by the crowds.
</p>
<p>
Crowds they had seen in some of the other large
cities, but never anything like this.
</p>
<p>
They took a trip to Coney Island on the second
day, and the girls were for going back again that
night. Mr. Willing agreed, and they were about
to fare forth from the hotel, when young Bristow
was announced.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve come to take you for that promised stroll,”
he told Dick.
</p>
<p>
Dick looked at the others inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
“You go with him,” nodded Colonel Ashton, “the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
rest of us can get along without you for one evening.”
</p>
<p>
“If I’m breaking up a party—” began Bristow.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” said the colonel with a wave of
his hand. “You two young fellows run along.
We don’t need you.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, sir,” agreed Dick.
</p>
<p>
Personally he was glad to have a chance to look
about the town a little with one of his own age.
The others took their departure, and soon Bristow
and Dick also left the hotel.
</p>
<p>
“I would have looked you up sooner but I have
been terribly busy,” explained Bristow. “I have
had important matters to attend to, and this is the
first time I have been at liberty. Where would you
like to go?”
</p>
<p>
“Any place you say,” said Dick with a smile.
“You know more about this place than I do.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you’re right,” was the smiling response,
“we’ll wander up Broadway aways and watch the
theater crowds.”
</p>
<p>
They did so, and continued to stroll about for
an hour.
</p>
<p>
Gradually the crowd thinned out, although there
were many pedestrians on the street. As they
stood for a moment in front of the Herald building
on Herald square, Dick, chancing to turn suddenly,
became conscious of a pair of eyes looking
steadily at his companion. He called the other’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
attention to it, and as the latter glanced about the
man turned and moved off.
</p>
<p>
Dick thought no more of the matter until several
blocks further along he perceived the same figure
slinking furtively after them.
</p>
<p>
“That man is following us,” he said to Bristow.
</p>
<p>
The face of the latter grew hard.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see,” he said.
</p>
<p>
At that moment they were passing Forty-second
Street, and Bristow swung sharply around the
corner. Dick followed him. They walked several
blocks, until they stood beneath the tracks of the
Sixth Avenue elevated. Here Bristow again
turned sharply, and drew up in a doorway. He
stopped as Dick came up beside him.
</p>
<p>
A moment later the figure of the man Dick believed
was following them came around the corner.
The man’s hat was pulled over his eyes, and he
did not glance up as he passed the doorway. Bristow
and Dick turned and doubled back around the
corner.
</p>
<p>
“He was after us, all right,” said Bristow with
a laugh, “but I guess we have given him the slip.”
</p>
<p>
But in this he was mistaken.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what on earth we are being followed
for?” muttered Dick to himself, as they turned
down Broadway. “Something queer about this fellow
Bristow. That man is not following us for
nothing.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
</p>
<p>
Several hours later they stopped in a little restaurant
for a bite to eat, “after which I’ll take you
home,” said Bristow.
</p>
<p>
The restaurant was crowded, and a little while
later the waiter seated another man at their table.
Dick gave him a quick glance and then stifled an
exclamation of surprise.
</p>
<p>
The newcomer was the same man who had followed
them so recently.
</p>
<p>
Dick leaned over and whispered to Bristow.
</p>
<p>
“So?” said Bristow. “We’ll see what he
wants.”
</p>
<p>
He looked the man squarely in the eyes and demanded:
</p>
<p>
“What are you following me for?”
</p>
<p>
The man looked at him and smiled pleasantly.
</p>
<p>
“I just want to keep you in sight,” he replied.
</p>
<p>
“Why?”
</p>
<p>
“You know, I guess. You don’t want me to
speak right out, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no,” replied Bristow, “but I’ll thank you
to follow me no longer.”
</p>
<p>
“Sorry,” was the reply, “but I am afraid I shall
have to.”
</p>
<p>
“I warn you,” said Bristow quietly, “to let me
alone. Is that plain enough?”
</p>
<p>
“Perfectly plain,” was the reply. “I’m sorry I
can’t accommodate you.”
</p>
<p>
He resumed his eating.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
Dick and Bristow finished their meal first and
rose to go. The other man waited until they were
at the door, then picked up his check and followed
them. And so when they passed out, he was right
behind them once more.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like this idea of being followed,” said
Dick. “What’s he want, anyhow?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll get rid of him,” replied Bristow, absolutely
ignoring Dick’s second question.
</p>
<p>
He turned down a side street, and they walked
for three or four blocks, at length coming to a
rather darker street. Here Bristow slipped around
the corner and motioned Dick to silence.
</p>
<p>
The footsteps of their pursuer came to their ears.
He drew nearer. Bristow advanced close to the
edge of the building.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do?” asked Dick.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll see,” was the brief response.
</p>
<p>
As the man came into view, Bristow suddenly
struck out with his right fist, and the man toppled
over.
</p>
<p>
Bristow turned to Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Come!” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
With one look at the fallen man Dick obeyed,
and they were soon beyond pursuit.
</p>
<p>
Dick had been taken by surprise by the suddenness
of Bristow’s attack. Try as he would he
could see no reason for it. He, as well as Bristow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
objected to being followed, but Dick would not
have taken such measures to elude his pursuer.
</p>
<p>
He followed his companion without a word, however,
and soon they were back at the hotel.
</p>
<p>
The others had not returned, but Bristow sat
down, announcing that he had something important
to say to Mr. Willing when the latter did get
back.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later, Colonel Ashton, Mr. Willing
and the two girls came in.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I see you beat us,” exclaimed Mr. Willing.
“Have a good time?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” replied Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Willing,” said Bristow, “I have something
of importance to say to you.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, sir,” came the answer, “out with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you all promise to repeat nothing of what
I may say?”
</p>
<p>
“Why all this air of secrecy?” demanded Mr.
Willing.
</p>
<p>
“That I cannot tell you, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course we’ll promise, Mr. Bristow,” declared
Shirley. “Surely, Dad, there is no reason
why we should tell any one anything.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing nodded.
</p>
<p>
“I will promise for myself and the others,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, sir. What I would say is this:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
Take my advice, and under no circumstances sail
on the <em>Yucatan</em> to-morrow!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing gazed at the young man in perfect
amazement, as did the others in the room. Mr.
Willing was the first to regain his composure.
</p>
<p>
“Why?” he asked quietly.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t go into explanations,” replied the young
man hurriedly; “all I can do is warn you that it
is not safe.”
</p>
<p>
“And why isn’t it safe?” asked Shirley, now taking
a hand in the conversation.
</p>
<p>
“That I cannot tell you, either. But you all
know that a state of war exists between the countries
of Europe.”
</p>
<p>
“What has that to do with us?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“You are asking me hard questions,” said Bristow,
“and I cannot answer as I would like to. Let
it be enough that there is danger because of it.
And if there should even be no danger aboard the
<em>Yucatan</em>, it will exist in Colon.”
</p>
<p>
“In Colon?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. One week from to-day Colon will no
longer be safe!”
</p>
<p>
“It is my belief you are out of your head, young
man,” declared Mr. Willing grimly.
</p>
<p>
Bristow shook his head positively.
</p>
<p>
“I am telling you facts,” he declared. “I can’t
say any more.”
</p>
<p>
“And why won’t we be safe aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
demanded Shirley. “The ship isn’t going to
sink, is it?”
</p>
<p>
“No, but—”
</p>
<p>
“No European country will dare to molest it,”
declared Dick, “and I can see no reason why there
should be danger at Colon.”
</p>
<p>
“I was afraid I couldn’t convince you,” said Bristow.
“However, I have done my best. Good
night.”
</p>
<p>
He bowed and left the room.
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose he is talking about, Dad?”
asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” was the reply, “and I don’t care.”
</p>
<p>
“All buncombe,” agreed Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t care what it is,” exclaimed Shirley.
“We have set our hearts on this trip, and we
are going to take it. That’s all there is about that.”
</p>
<p>
“Good for you, Shirley,” agreed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Dick Stanley was the only member of the party
who did not speak. He sat quietly in his chair,
thinking.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V.—ABOARD THE YUCATAN.</h2>
<p>
The <em>Yucatan</em>, upon leaving New York, did not
head straight for Colon. Her route took her down
the coast, where she would make several stops.
The first would be at Savannah, then Jacksonville,
and the third, and last before touching at Colon,
would be Havana, Cuba.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing had selected this vessel for the
simple reason that it did put in at these southern
ports, for he wished to give the girls an opportunity
of seeing as much as possible on the journey.
After rounding into the Pacific, following her passage
of the Panama Canal, the vessel was scheduled
to put in at the seaports of several of the Central
American republics and one or two Mexican ports.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing, Colonel Ashton, Dick and the two
girls stood forward on the gallery deck of the great
ship as she got under way and slowly backed out
of her slip into the North River.
</p>
<p>
It was early afternoon, the sun shone brightly
and it was very warm. All day the city had sweltered
beneath the terrible heat, but as the ship gradually
gathered headway a breeze sprang up and
blew refreshingly across the deck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“This is something like it,” declared Mr. Willing,
removing his yachting cap and passing his
handkerchief over his forehead.
</p>
<p>
The awnings were stretched, and all took the
steamer chairs they had secured. These they
pulled close to the rail, and then gazed off across
the water.
</p>
<p>
Directly the Statue of Liberty came into view.
The girls gazed at it curiously as they passed and
headed for the open sea.
</p>
<p>
Gradually the lofty spires of the great buildings
faded from view, and then the Statue of Liberty
disappeared. To starboard could be seen the distant
shore of New Jersey, and to port nothing but
the broad expanse of the Atlantic.
</p>
<p>
Darkness descended and with it a cooler breeze.
</p>
<p>
“Time to eat,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
They made their way to the dining room below,
where they were seated at the captain’s table. The
supper was excellent, far beyond Shirley’s expectations.
The meal over they returned on deck.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing had secured a suite of four rooms
well forward on the promenade deck, and after
enjoying the cooling breeze for some time, all
made their way there.
</p>
<p>
The strains of a band now floated to them from
the main salon. They made their way out. Then
the three young people started on a tour of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
ship. They took in everything with breathless interest.
</p>
<p>
“This is indeed a floating palace,” commented
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it though,” agreed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Dick was no less enthusiastic in his praise.
</p>
<p>
After a stroll about they rejoined the two elder
men in the salon. Then it was that Shirley bethought
herself of the fact that young Bristow had
said he would be aboard.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t seen anything of him,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Neither had the others.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he missed the boat,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have a look at the passenger list,” said
Dick.
</p>
<p>
He did so, and there he saw “Henry Bristow,
New York,” and the number of his stateroom.
He went up and knocked on the door.
</p>
<p>
“Come in,” called a voice.
</p>
<p>
Dick entered the room, then started back in surprise.
</p>
<p>
Bristow lay propped up in bed, reading. Around
his head was a white bandage. Dick hastened to
his side.
</p>
<p>
“Why, what is the matter?” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Accident,” replied Bristow, with a slight smile,
and volunteered no further information.
</p>
<p>
Dick did not press him for an explanation.
After some little talk, in the course of which Bristow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
said he did not require anything and announced
that he would be perfectly fit on the morrow, Dick
took his leave and rejoined the others.
</p>
<p>
“And how was he hurt?” asked Mr. Willing,
after Dick had reported what he had learned.
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t say and I didn’t ask him,” he replied.
“But I am sure there is something strange
about it, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I am beginning to think that myself,” agreed
Colonel Ashton. “He’s a queer one. Now, I
wonder why he warned us not to sail on this ship?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s too deep for me,” declared Dick.
</p>
<p>
“I have it,” exclaimed Shirley suddenly. “Perhaps
he is an agent of one of the foreign countries,
England or Germany.”
</p>
<p>
Dick looked at the girl in unfeigned surprise.
</p>
<p>
“What makes you think that?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. I don’t really believe it; I just
happened to think of it. Wouldn’t it be fun if he
was?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that all depends,” replied Dick. “It depends
on what his business aboard would be.”
</p>
<p>
“But what could it be in such a case?” questioned
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it might be lots of things. But I don’t
put any stock in such an explanation.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor I,” declared Mr. Willing. “It’s my belief
the young man is in trouble of some kind, and I’d
like to help him out if I could. I like him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
“And so do I,” agreed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“To tell the truth, I don’t know whether I do or
not,” said Dick slowly. “He’s agreeable, and all
that; but there is something very peculiar about
him. I am sure there is something wrong.”
</p>
<p>
“If I get a good chance, I shall ask him,” declared
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have about the same luck Dad did when
he asked him his business,” retorted Shirley, “and
that wasn’t much.”
</p>
<p>
“Take my advice, all of you, and let him alone,”
remarked Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
“That is good advice, Ashton,” declared Mr.
Willing. “But come, it’s bedtime and we shall want
to be about early in the morning to enjoy some of
this ocean breeze.”
</p>
<p>
An hour later all were asleep.
</p>
<p>
Had they been about they would have seen a
strange sight.
</p>
<p>
On the upper deck aft, as the ship’s bell chimed
midnight, three men sat in deep conversation.
Two of them were strangers, but the third Shirley
or any of her party would immediately have recognized
as Henry Bristow.
</p>
<p>
And there would also have been something else
noticeable. The bandage had been removed from
his head, nor was there wound nor swelling to show
why it should have been tied up in the first place.
</p>
<p>
The three men talked for perhaps fifteen minutes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
in low whispers and then parted, going their several
ways.
</p>
<p>
As he had promised, Bristow was about the ship
the following morning, but his head was once more
bandaged. Mabel, true to her words of the night
before, seized the first opportunity and asked him
how he had been injured.
</p>
<p>
“That,” was the quiet reply, “I cannot say.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel was highly indignant, and took herself off,
leaving the young man smiling after her. Then he
shrugged his shoulders and walked away.
</p>
<p>
All morning the sun shone warm and bright,
though it was not too hot for comfort. It was
shortly after noon when the passengers were treated
to an interesting sight.
</p>
<p>
Some distance to port came the smoke of another
ship, and as it drew nearer an air of subdued
excitement became apparent on the <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
“Armed cruiser off the port bow, sir!” came the
hail from the lookout.
</p>
<p>
All rushed toward the rail, and stood looking at
the large ship of war, as she bore down toward
them. There was no flag at her masthead, and so
the passengers were unable to determine her nationality.
</p>
<p>
“What can she be?” exclaimed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“British, I suppose,” was Dick’s answer. “She’ll
show her colors presently, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
Dick was right. Five minutes later the British
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
ensign was run up the masthead and fluttered in
the breeze.
</p>
<p>
A great cheer broke from most of the passengers
aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>. Shirley and Mabel joined in
it.
</p>
<p>
At that moment Dick caught sight of the face
of Bristow, who stood near. His lips were compressed,
and he scowled fiercely.
</p>
<p>
“He’s no Englishman, that’s sure,” muttered the
young man to himself.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, from across the water, came the sound
of a big gun, and a solid shot struck the water dead
ahead of the <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
Immediately her engines were stopped, and the
passenger steamer came to a stop.
</p>
<p>
Instantly wild alarm spread over the ship.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve been fired on,” cried Shirley. “Will
they sink us?”
</p>
<p>
Dick smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I guess not,” he replied. “That’s just a
signal to heave-to and give an account of ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“But what business have they stopping an American
ship?” exclaimed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“It is permissible under the laws of war,” explained
Dick. “You see, the <em>Yucatan</em> might be an
enemy flying the American flag. As soon as they
find out we are all right, they will allow us to proceed.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
“And would we have to stop just the same for a
German?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t like that,” declared Shirley. “I
don’t mind the English. My grandmother was
English, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess my sympathies are a little that
way, too,” agreed Dick.
</p>
<p>
The wireless now began to sputter as messages
were exchanged between the <em>Yucatan</em> and the British
cruiser. The latter had approached close
enough to make out the <em>Yucatan</em>, and now signalled
her to proceed on her course.
</p>
<p>
As the big ship of war turned and made off, a
second ovation was given her by the passengers.
Men waved their hats and women their handkerchiefs.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Shirley seized Dick by the arm, and
pointed, whispering:
</p>
<p>
“Look at that!”
</p>
<p>
Far aft, Henry Bristow gazed across the water
at the British cruiser, and Shirley had perceived
that there was hate in his eyes. Even as Dick
looked in the direction Shirley pointed, Bristow
raised a fist and shook it fiercely at the receding
war vessel, while strange words issued from between
his lips.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI.—SHIRLEY LENDS AID.</h2>
<p>
“Look, Mabel, did you see that woman steal that
bolt of silk?”
</p>
<p>
It was Shirley who spoke. They stood among
the crowd that thronged the largest department
store in Savannah, Ga. The <em>Yucatan</em> had put into
Savannah early that morning, and learning that the
vessel would not get under way again until late in
the afternoon, Shirley and Mabel had gone uptown
to purchase a few souvenirs of the Georgia city.
</p>
<p>
It was just after entering the store that Shirley’s
attention was attracted by the peculiar actions of a
young woman who darted somewhat furtively from
one counter to another. While the attention of the
clerks was given to customers, Shirley had seen the
woman slip a bolt of expensive silk from the counter
and hide it under a long flowing cape, which she
wore in spite of the heat.
</p>
<p>
Mabel shook her head negatively in response to
Shirley’s question.
</p>
<p>
“Which one?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
Shirley pointed to the figure of the woman who
was now gazing at a pretty array of expensive laces.
Both girls watched her carefully; and directly, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
the crowd about her became more dense, they saw
her hand go stealthily forth and take several small
bolts of the high-priced material.
</p>
<p>
“Well what do you think of that?” demanded
Mabel. “I have heard of such things, but I never
expected to see it. What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing,” replied Shirley decidedly. “It’s none
of our business.”
</p>
<p>
“But won’t the poor clerks have to make good
the loss?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about that. But if we get mixed
up in it we are likely to gain too much notoriety.
Let’s move away from here.”
</p>
<p>
They pushed their way through the crowd when
Shirley came suddenly into violent contact with a
figure hurrying from the opposite direction. The
latter drew back and lifted his cap.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Willing,” he said. “I beg your pardon.
I didn’t look where I was going.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley glanced up in surprise at hearing her
name spoken. Then she recognized the figure with
whom she had collided.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mr. Bristow,” she said. “I thought I
left you aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“I came ashore to do a little shopping, as you
young ladies call it,” replied Bristow with a laugh.
“I shall have to hurry on.”
</p>
<p>
He lifted his cap and was gone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
The two girls continued to stroll about through
the store, eyeing the bargains appreciatively.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess we have seen enough,” said Mabel
finally. “We may as well return to the ship.”
</p>
<p>
As they started toward the door they became
aware of the sounds of confusion behind them.
For a moment they hesitated, then their curiosity
overcame them and they turned back.
</p>
<p>
Far down the aisle a large crowd had gathered.
The girls could hear the loud tones of one of the
floor walkers calling for the store detective. Shirley
and Mabel elbowed their way through the
crowd, and presently were able to see what was
going on.
</p>
<p>
Shirley uttered an exclamation of amazement and
clutched Mabel by the arm.
</p>
<p>
“Look at that!” she cried in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
And well might she have been amazed. For
there, in the center of the crowd, his arm grasped
tightly by the big floor walker, was Henry Bristow.
</p>
<p>
His face was red and he was plainly very angry.
However, he was making no effort to release himself.
He controlled himself with an effort and
spoke.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you you are making a mistake,” he said
quietly, and his voice carried to the two girls.
</p>
<p>
“Is that so?” sneered the floor walker. “So
you deny you are a shop-lifter, eh? Well, I didn’t
suppose you would admit it. How do you account
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
for the possession of this valuable piece of lace the
clerk saw you getting away with?”
</p>
<p>
“It must have caught on my coat,” was the reply.
“I didn’t try to steal it.”
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t, eh? We’ll see as soon as the house
detective arrives. I reckon you have plenty of stuff
stowed away in your pockets.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I haven’t,” declared Bristow angrily.
“You’re going to be sorry for this before you get
through.”
</p>
<p>
“Well what do you think of that?” demanded
Mabel, who had stood with open mouth during this
conversation.
</p>
<p>
“I think that he is innocent,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
She glanced quickly around the store, and as she
did so her eyes fell upon the woman she had so recently
seen appropriating articles from the counter.
</p>
<p>
“There goes the woman who did it,” she declared,
pointing.
</p>
<p>
Mabel looked and nodded her head.
</p>
<p>
The woman was coming directly toward them,
pushing her way through the crowd vigorously.
Shirley stepped forward and barred her progress.
</p>
<p>
At the same moment Shirley raised her voice and
called out:
</p>
<p>
“That man is innocent, Mr. Floorwalker. Here
is the shop-lifter.”
</p>
<p>
The woman again tried to push by Shirley, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
the latter maneuvered so as to be directly in front
of her at every step.
</p>
<p>
Shirley’s words caused a commotion. Willing
hands darted out and seized the woman, and she
was taken before the man who still grasped young
Bristow by the arm.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel pushed their way forward.
</p>
<p>
“I saw this woman steal a bolt of silk and some
laces,” declared Shirley. “I would have said nothing
about it had not Mr. Bristow, whom I know,
been accused.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t true!” cried the woman. “The girl is
in the plot with the man.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley’s face grew red.
</p>
<p>
“I am not!” she declared. “This woman is
guilty. She put the things under that long cape.”
</p>
<p>
The floor walker was plainly mystified. He
glanced from one to the other.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it will do no harm to have a look,” he
declared. He turned to the woman. “Will you
remove your cape, madam?”
</p>
<p>
The woman drew back, and pulled the garment
closer about her.
</p>
<p>
“No, I won’t!” she declared, “I—”
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” said the floor walker. “I shall
have the floor matron search you.”
</p>
<p>
He turned and called to one of the clerks. But
the woman waited for no more. With a single
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
move she took off her cape, and threw it to the
floor.
</p>
<p>
“There,” she said, throwing out her arms, “you
may see that I have nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“I saw her take them,” declared Shirley, looking
at the woman in surprise, for she could not see a
sign of a stolen article.
</p>
<p>
A frown gathered on the floor walker’s face as
he glanced at Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“This looks rather bad for you.” he said to her
pointedly.
</p>
<p>
Shirley took a step back.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” she asked in no little
alarm.
</p>
<p>
“It seems that the lady is telling the truth. What
was your object in accusing her?”
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I saw her take them,” declared Shirley
again.
</p>
<p>
The floor walker shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
It was Mabel who finally cleared up the situation.
The woman’s cape still lay on the floor where she
had thrown it. Mabel stooped down to pick it up,
and as she did so the woman also snatched at it.
</p>
<p>
But Mabel was the quicker of the two and captured
the garment. Quickly she turned it wrong
side out, and as she did so there was a gasp from
the crowd.
</p>
<p>
For the inside of the coat was literally filled
with secret pockets. Mabel thrust her hand in and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
pulled out the bolt of silk. She held it above her
head.
</p>
<p>
“Here it is!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“I bought and paid for that,” sputtered the angry
woman.
</p>
<p>
One after another Mabel now produced other
articles of value, which she exposed to the view of
the crowd. And in each case the woman’s explanation
was the same:
</p>
<p>
“I paid for that!”
</p>
<p>
But the floor walker was not to be fooled, nor
was the manager of the store, who came up at that
moment. The former released his hold on young Bristow
and made him an abject apology.
</p>
<p>
One of the women detectives was called, and the
shop-lifter turned over to her. Then the manager
addressed Shirley and Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I owe you two young ladies a debt of gratitude,”
he said. “This shop-lifting has been going on for
a month or more and we have lost heavily. Thanks
to you I believe we have the culprit at last. Without
your assistance she would have escaped.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel acknowledged this praise with
slight inclinations of the heads, and then Shirley
spoke to Young Bristow, who stood near.
</p>
<p>
“Are you going back to the boat, Mr. Bristow?
We shall be glad of your company.”
</p>
<p>
The young man accepted this invitation, and the
three made their way from the store.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
“I can’t thank you enough, either of you,” he
declared as they walked along. “I was in a ticklish
position, and but for your assistance might have
been put to no end of trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“How did you happen to be accused?” asked
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I was walking through the aisle, and because
of the crowd I was shoved against the
counter. A piece of lace caught on a button of my
coat, and I dragged it with me as I went by. Then
the girl behind the counter cried out that some
one had stolen something. The floor walker saw
the lace caught in my coat and collared me. That’s
all.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” said Shirley, and added with a smile:
“You certainly did look funny there!”
</p>
<p>
“Did I? Well, I didn’t feel very funny. I was
afraid I would be held long enough to make me
miss the ship, and I can’t afford to do that.”
</p>
<p>
“Then your business in Colon is very important?”
asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Young Bristow looked at her in silence for some
moments, and Mabel grew red as she thought she
was to be rebuffed again. But she wasn’t. Bristow
finally answered her question.
</p>
<p>
“Very important,” he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
“By the way,” said Shirley as they walked along,
“how is your wound? I see you have removed the
bandage.”
</p>
<p>
A startled expression flitted across the young
man’s face, but neither girl perceived it.
</p>
<p>
“It’s much better,” he made answer. “Not even
a scar left. It didn’t amount to much, after all.”
</p>
<p>
Fifteen minutes later they were back aboard the
<em>Yucatan</em>, where Shirley related their experiences to
others of their party.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have to keep a closer watch on you two,”
declared Mr. Willing. “Every time you get away
by yourselves you run into trouble. And you won’t
always come out of it so easily.”
</p>
<p>
Several hours later the big steamship moved majestically
out of the harbor and soon was headed
down the coast once more. She came to anchor
again the following morning at Jacksonville, the
last American port at which she would touch until
she reached San Diego, California. The Willing
party went ashore again, but this time, true to his
word, Mr. Willing would not permit the girls to
wander away by themselves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
As they strolled about, Shirley became suddenly
ill. She knew it was nothing serious, brought on
probably by the excessive heat. Therefore she informed
the others that she was going back aboard
the ship, as she wished to lie down. Mabel agreed
to go with her.
</p>
<p>
The fathers saw the two girls into a taxicab,
which soon dropped them at the pier, where they
immediately went to their suite.
</p>
<p>
Shirley felt much better now that she was out
of the sun, and lying down on the sofa picked up a
book and commenced to read. Mabel sat down at
a little desk to write a letter.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the cooling breeze made by the electric
fan in the room, it was still rather warm, and
Mabel left the outer door open to get what breeze
they could from over the water. Mabel was in
the first room, and Shirley in the one beyond.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Mabel heard footsteps running down
the deck toward their suite. She glanced up idly,
wondering why any one should put himself to
so much exertion on such a hot day, and even as
she looked up a figure darted into the room and
closed the door behind him.
</p>
<p>
Mabel jumped quickly to her feet and faced the
newcomer, who, she now perceived, held a revolver
in his hand.
</p>
<p>
Mabel was not frightened by the sight of the
weapon, for she was not unacquainted with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
use of firearms and had faced more than one dangerous
situation; but as the man turned and faced
her, she uttered a cry of amazement.
</p>
<p>
The man was Henry Bristow.
</p>
<p>
Bristow, who had not perceived that the room
was occupied, turned at the sound of Mabel’s voice,
his revolver half raised. At sight of Mabel he
dropped his arm, and removed his cap.
</p>
<p>
“Please pardon me for this intrusion,” he said
quietly. “I did not know the cabin was occupied
nor whose it was. I just happened to see the door
open, and I slipped in.”
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter?” asked Mabel, who realized
that something must be wrong.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, nothing,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
Before Mabel could utter another word, there
was a loud knock on the closed door.
</p>
<p>
Shirley, in response to the knock, came in from
the next room. She took in the situation at a
glance, but did not betray her surprise by so much
as an exclamation. She advanced quickly toward
Mabel and young Bristow.
</p>
<p>
“What is wrong?” she asked in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
Bristow waved his revolver toward the door.
</p>
<p>
“They want me,” he said. “I can’t allow you
girls to be drawn into this, so I shall go out.”
</p>
<p>
A dark expression passed over his face, and his
hand tightened on the revolver. Shirley became
alarmed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
</p>
<p>
She motioned him to the room beyond.
</p>
<p>
“You go in there,” she said. “No one will
bother you.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment Bristow hesitated, then he bowed
and passed in. As he went by her, Mabel reached
out and relieved him of his revolver. Bristow
started to protest, then changed his mind and said
nothing.
</p>
<p>
Mabel motioned to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“You go in too,” she said. “I’ll stay here.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley obeyed without a word. Then Mabel
walked to the little center table, and put the revolver
in the drawer.
</p>
<p>
Came another sharp knock on the door. Mabel
advanced and threw it open.
</p>
<p>
Three men stood in the doorway, and all removed
their hats at sight of her.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” demanded Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“We are searching for a man named Von
Blusen, who is aboard this ship. We trailed him
down the deck here, and he disappeared. Have
you seen him?”
</p>
<p>
“I know no one by that name,” returned Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“He’s a young fellow,” went on the spokesman
of the three, “and a very smooth-spoken chap. All
the other cabins are locked but this one. I happen
to know that this door was open a few minutes
ago. I thought he might possibly have come in
here?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
He looked at Mabel inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
“I know no one by that name,” declared the girl
again.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you know him by some other name,
then?”
</p>
<p>
Mabel did not reply.
</p>
<p>
The man became suspicious.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid we shall have to search this cabin,
miss,” he said. “I am not convinced he is not in
here.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it you want with this man?” asked
Mabel, her curiosity getting the better of her.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t mind telling you. Von Blusen is
a German and I have been tipped off that he is up
to some mischief, I don’t know just what. My
orders are to take him ashore and turn him over
to the U. S. authorities.”
</p>
<p>
“And who are you?” demanded Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Me? Why, I’m a United States special officer.”
</p>
<p>
He threw back his coat and exposed a badge,
which he covered hurriedly. Mabel, therefore, did
not see it clearly. Something seemed to tell her,
however, that the man was not telling the truth.
</p>
<p>
She stepped back quickly to the little center table,
and as the first man advanced after her, she quickly
opened the drawer and produced Bristow’s revolver,
which she levelled at the three men.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t come in here,” she said quietly.
</p>
<p>
The foremost man drew back, as did the others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“But, miss,” said the spokesman, “we must search
the cabin. I am sure Von Blusen came in here.
Will you deny it?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t have to deny it,” declared Mabel angrily.
“If you are United States officers, as you
claim, you will have some means of identification.”
</p>
<p>
“I showed you my badge,” said the man.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and you were careful that I didn’t get a
good look at it.”
</p>
<p>
“But we must make the search.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you must have an order. I know that
much. I know you have to have a piece of paper,
or something—a warrant I believe it is called.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t any warrant now,” was the reply,
“but I am going to make the search just the same.”
</p>
<p>
He stepped forward, but Mabel covered him
with her revolver.
</p>
<p>
“You have come in here against my command,”
she said quietly, “and I should be perfectly justified
in shooting you, as I would a burglar.”
</p>
<p>
The man sought to temporize.
</p>
<p>
“Now, see here miss—” he began.
</p>
<p>
Mabel took a step forward. She was growing
angry.
</p>
<p>
“You just get right out of here,” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
The man drew back a step and scratched his head
perplexedly.
</p>
<p>
“Miss,” he said, “you are making a big mistake
to shield this man. I tell you he is plotting mischief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
which may involve the United States in war.
We must have him before the ship sails.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you won’t get him in here,” declared the
girl.
</p>
<p>
Again the man hesitated, then seemed on the
point of moving forward again.
</p>
<p>
“I warn you for the last time to get out of here,”
said Mabel very quietly.
</p>
<p>
Once more her revolver came to bear on the
man, and he drew back, throwing up his hands with
a gesture of dismay. Then he turned to his companions.
</p>
<p>
“What can we do against that?” he asked. “We
can’t use a girl roughly, and if the ship gets beyond
the three-mile limit, we can’t get him till we
reach Colon.”
</p>
<p>
“Guess we’ll have to wait then,” said one of the
others.
</p>
<p>
“Yep, guess we will.”
</p>
<p>
The leader turned to Mabel and made her a low
bow.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry you interfered with us,” he said.
“You’ll find before long that you have done wrong.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I shall,” said Mabel; “but I couldn’t
permit you to invade my cabin.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell you what, Tim,” said one of the men,
“we’ll just camp out here and get him when he
comes out. He’s likely to come out before we sail.”
</p>
<p>
“Good idea,” agreed the leader. “We’ll do it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
Again he made a low bow to Mabel and followed
his men out.
</p>
<p>
“Sorry to have troubled you,” he muttered as
he took his departure.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Bristow now came in from the other
room.
</p>
<p>
“You did splendidly, Miss Ashton,” declared
Bristow warmly. “I was afraid you would allow
them to enter.”
</p>
<p>
Before Mabel could reply there came the sound
of voices outside. One, raised in anger, was that
of Mr. Willing. A moment later, followed by
Colonel Ashton and Dick, he entered the room.
</p>
<p>
His gaze fell upon Henry Bristow.
</p>
<p>
“So,” he growled, “it’s you they’re after, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” returned Bristow quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you sit down over there, young man,”
said Mr. Willing, pointing to a chair. “I’m going
to tell you a few things, and I don’t care whether
you like them or not.”
</p>
<h2><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII.—THEIR FIRST QUARREL.</h2>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel glanced at Mr. Willing in
surprise. Young Bristow took the seat indicated,
and the others also sat down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“First,” said Mr. Willing to Bristow, “I am going
to ask you a question or two. If you refuse
to answer, I shall, of course, draw my own conclusions.”
</p>
<p>
The young man nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Proceed, sir,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“All right. Now, in the first place, are you connected,
in any capacity, with the German government?”
</p>
<p>
“That I cannot answer,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Very good! Now, then, are you aboard this
ship at the command of the German government?”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot answer that question, either, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Suit yourself. Is it not a fact that those with
whom you come in contact—those who seem to be
your friends—are in danger because of their associations
with you?”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you are right, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Just as I expected,” declared Mr. Willing.
“Now I’ve got this to say. Already you have been
the means of getting my daughter and the colonel’s
daughter into your scrapes. They have come to
your assistance twice. Also Dick has been with
you on one adventure. You will admit that, of
course?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Good. Then here is my ultimatum: I want
you to keep away from me and mine. I don’t want
you to cross this threshold again; and I don’t want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
you to speak to any of us should you chance to
encounter us. Do I make myself plain?”
</p>
<p>
“Perfectly, sir,” replied Bristow rising from his
chair, his face pale.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad I do,” declared Mr. Willing. “I
haven’t any use for a spy, be he German or English.
Now you can get out of here.”
</p>
<p>
Without a word Bristow moved toward the door.
But Mabel leaped forward and barred his path.
She turned to Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Surely you wouldn’t send him out to be captured?”
she exclaimed. “Those men are waiting
for him out there.”
</p>
<p>
“That is none of our affair,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“I agree with Mabel in that,” declared Shirley.
“If he goes out before we are beyond the three-mile
limit, he will be taken prisoner.”
</p>
<p>
“And if he isn’t there is no telling what may
happen,” commented Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Dad,” said Shirley, “please let him stay until
we have passed the three-mile limit? Please!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I agree,” he said at length.
</p>
<p>
Bristow spoke to Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“I shall stay, sir,” he said, “but it is because I
must avoid capture if it is possible. Otherwise
I wouldn’t stay in the same room with you.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing smiled. He didn’t mind that kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
of talk, but not so Shirley. She sprang to her feet
and faced Bristow angrily.
</p>
<p>
“How dare you speak to my father like that?”
she demanded. “How dare you?”
</p>
<p>
Bristow turned his head away, and made no reply.
</p>
<p>
Mabel quickly came to the support of Bristow.
</p>
<p>
“And why shouldn’t he?” she asked. “He
hasn’t done anything and your father was very
mean.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mabel,” exclaimed Shirley in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“I mean it,” declared Mabel. “Your father
was mean.”
</p>
<p>
“He couldn’t be too mean to a German,” exclaimed
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“You people make me tired,” declared Mabel angrily.
“Why are you forever jumping on the Germans?
They are in the right and they are going to
win.”
</p>
<p>
“They are not!” This from Shirley. “The
English are going to win, and I hope they do!”
</p>
<p>
“And I hope the Germans win,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley! Mabel!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing and Colonel Ashton had now taken
a hand in the conversation. But both girls were
too angry to heed them.
</p>
<p>
“And just because this man is a German you
are all against him. If he were English you would
be shaking hands with him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
Mabel was losing control of herself.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Mabel,” said Shirley. “You know that
is not true.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it is true,” declared the girl.
</p>
<p>
Colonel Ashton took her firmly by the arm.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel, I am surprised at you,” he said. “Go
to your room.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s Shirley’s room, it’s not mine,” cried Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Shirley advanced toward her friend.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel, what do you mean?” she asked quietly.
</p>
<p>
“You know what I mean. You told me I wasn’t
telling the truth.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley compressed her lips and stepped back.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing took a hand in the conversation.
</p>
<p>
“Unless this foolishness ceases we shall leave the
boat at Havana and return home immediately,” he
said quietly. “I will have none of this.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care,” declared Shirley, also now very
angry.
</p>
<p>
“Neither do I,” this from Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley, go to your room,” ordered Mr. Willing.
“I am your father and I will be obeyed.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley glanced at her father’s stern face, and
obeyed. She knew that when he looked like that
he was not to be trifled with.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel, you go with her,” said Colonel Ashton
quietly.
</p>
<p>
Mabel hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Do you hear me?” asked the colonel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
Mabel also realized that she had gone too far.
She made her way after Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Inside their room the girls did not speak to each
other. In the heart of each there was a peculiar
feeling, and each knew that, in a measure, she
was to blame. But neither was ready to give in
yet.
</p>
<p>
It was their first quarrel.
</p>
<p>
Outside Mr. Willing turned to young Bristow.
</p>
<p>
“This,” he said, “is your doing. And when you
once set foot outside this cabin, don’t you ever
cross my path again.”
</p>
<p>
The <em>Yucatan</em> was under way now, and from the
window Mr. Willing could see the three men still
waiting on the outside. But at last they took their
departure and Mr. Willing knew they had passed
beyond the three-mile limit. He turned again to
Bristow.
</p>
<p>
“Now Bristow or Von Blusen or whatever your
name is,” he said, “get out.”
</p>
<p>
Bristow turned a dark look upon him.
</p>
<p>
“You have insulted me,” he said, “and you shall
pay for it.”
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t insult you, you little whipper-snapper,”
said Mr. Willing angrily. “Are you going
to get out of here?”
</p>
<p>
“When I’ve had my say,” declared the young
man angrily. “If it were not that I am on important
business I would chastise you right now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is it because you have important business or
because you are a child?” asked Mr. Willing smiling.
</p>
<p>
Bristow took a threatening step forward, but now
Dick took a hand.
</p>
<p>
“That’s enough of this,” he said sternly, and putting
forth a hand he pushed Bristow back.
</p>
<p>
The latter’s face turned a dull red, and he struck
at Dick, who promptly slapped him across the face.
Dick also was angry now.
</p>
<p>
“You shall pay for that blow,” shouted Bristow.
“I can’t fight you now, but when I have
completed my work I shall seek you out.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t be very hard to find,” declared Dick.
“Now get out.”
</p>
<p>
He took the infuriated Bristow by the neck and
the bottom of the coat and ran him out the door.
Then he closed it after him.
</p>
<p>
“Rather a fiery young man, that,” remarked Colonel
Ashton grimly.
</p>
<p>
“Rather,” agreed Mr. Willing dryly. He turned
to the other room and called: “Shirley! Mabel!”
</p>
<p>
A moment later the two girls came forth. Mr.
Willing looked at them severely for some moments
before he spoke.
</p>
<p>
“You should both be ashamed of yourselves,”
he said at last. “The idea of such foolishness.
Why, you have never quarreled before.”
</p>
<p>
“And there will be no more of it,” declared Colonel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
Ashton grimly. “At the next sign of trouble
we shall turn right around and go home.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Mabel started it,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I did not, you started it,” exclaimed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley!” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel!” exclaimed Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
The girls became silent, but continued to glare
at each other.
</p>
<p>
Then, suddenly, a smile broke over Shirley’s
face. Her father breathed more freely. Even
Colonel Ashton looked at the two girls eagerly.
</p>
<p>
Then Shirley advanced toward Mabel and held
out her hand.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry for what I said, Mabel,” she declared
earnestly.
</p>
<p>
For a moment Mabel hesitated, but for a moment
only. Then she jumped quickly forward, and
ignoring her friend’s outstretched hand, threw her
arms around her and broke into tears.
</p>
<p>
“It was all my fault,” she sobbed. “You didn’t
say anything.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes I did, too,” said Shirley. “It was as much
my fault as it was yours.”
</p>
<p>
“No it wasn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes it was.”
</p>
<p>
“It was not.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls drew back from each other.
</p>
<p>
“I say it was,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“And I say it wasn’t,” declared Mabel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter with you two?” demanded
Mr. Willing, stepping between them.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing, Dad,” said Shirley, smiling again.
She turned again to Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry,” she said quietly.
</p>
<p>
“And so am I,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Once more they fell into each other’s arms, laughing
happily. Then, arm in arm, they turned and
made their way to their own rooms, absolutely
ignoring the presence of the others.
</p>
<p>
Dick, who had felt decidedly uncomfortable during
this scene, grinned foolishly. Colonel Ashton
laughed aloud, and Mr. Willing smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Funny things happen, my boy,” exclaimed the
latter, slapping Dick on the back. “You learn
something every minute.”
</p>
<p>
And in the other room Mabel said:
</p>
<p>
“We shall never, never quarrel again.”
</p>
<p>
“Never!” agreed Shirley.
</p>
<h2><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX.—ADRIFT.</h2>
<p>
In the distance the Cuban city of Havana was
slipping slowly from sight. Aft on the promenade
deck Shirley, Mabel and the others of the party,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
together with many other passengers, were casting
last looks at the island metropolis.
</p>
<p>
The sun was just sinking below the horizon, but
there were still several hours before darkness would
fall. The view was indeed picturesque and the
passengers were impressed with it.
</p>
<p>
The steamship <em>Yucatan</em> was now on the last leg
of her journey toward Colon.
</p>
<p>
In the main salon a crowd of men had gathered.
On the upper deck, the gallery deck, the promenade
deck and the main deck they had also gathered in
knots. They blocked the main staircase and the
exits from the engine room below.
</p>
<p>
A group somewhat larger than the rest had assembled
about the captain’s cabin. A close observer
would have noticed that each man among
these different groups wore a peculiar little button
in the lapel of his coat.
</p>
<p>
Each group was silent. It appeared that they
were waiting for something. Now a young man
appeared and spoke to the first group holding his
open watch in his hand. Then he passed on to
the next, then to the next, until he had approached
all. Then he took his place with the others near
the bridge, and waited, watch in hand.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he pulled a little whistle from his
pocket, put it to his lips, waited a moment, and
then blew a shrill blast, that penetrated to the
farthest part of the ship.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p>
Instantly the various groups of men wearing the
button of peculiar design came to action.
</p>
<p>
The passengers on the promenade deck, the Willing
party among them, found themselves under the
muzzles of many revolvers. On the gallery, the
deck, the main salon, the grand stairway a like condition
prevailed.
</p>
<p>
Only the men who guarded the exit from the
engine and boiler rooms were inactive, but these
stood with drawn revolvers.
</p>
<p>
A dozen men swarmed from the bridge into the
wheel house, where they confronted the pilot, the
Captain, the first and second officers, who chanced
to be there together. Officers in other parts of the
ship also had been held up.
</p>
<p>
The surprise had been complete. The <em>Yucatan</em>
was at the mercy of this army of conspirators, whoever
they chanced to be.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel had eyed the strange proceedings
upon their section of the ship with no less
amazement than the rest of the passengers. Mr.
Willing, Colonel Ashton and Dick were equally astonished.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, a wholesale hold-up?” demanded the
colonel.
</p>
<p>
“Worse, I’m afraid,” declared Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“I know!” exclaimed Shirley suddenly. “Mr.
Bristow is concerned in this.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! I believe you are right Shirley,”
declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I know I am right,” returned Shirley positively.
“This is why he sailed on the <em>Yucatan</em>.”
</p>
<p>
In the meantime the captors of the vessel had
relieved all on board of whatever weapons they
had. They had made a systematic search of the
cabins, while some of their number kept the crew
and passengers covered. Of the many aboard the
ship the only ones who did not know what had
happened were the engine crew and stokers.
</p>
<p>
The wireless had been among the first points
seized, and the operator had had no opportunity
of sending a message.
</p>
<p>
And now a young man moved about among the
passengers, assuring them that there was no danger
so long as they kept quiet. This young man
came aft on the promenade deck where the Willing
party stood.
</p>
<p>
Even as Shirley had surmised, he was Henry
Bristow.
</p>
<p>
He smiled as he approached them.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” growled Mr. Willing, “I see you have
put the thing through.”
</p>
<p>
“Part of it sir, part of it,” was the reply. “The
rest is to come.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do now, Mr. Bristow?”
asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
The latter smiled at her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
“Captain Von Blusen, if you please, Miss Ashton,”
he said, “I am no longer Henry Bristow, but
Captain Friederich Von Blusen, of His Imperial
Majesty’s service.”
</p>
<p>
“And what are you going to do with the ship?”
asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Why, we shall do a little cruising,” was the
reply. “We have established a naval base off the
coast of Cuba, but we have no ships on this side
of the Atlantic. Therefore we must have ships.
This is the first.”
</p>
<p>
“And what are you going to do with us, captain?”
asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, that is the hard part,” was the reply, “but,
before starting, we came to a conclusion, though
none of the passengers is likely to be pleased. We
shall set you adrift in small boats.”
</p>
<p>
The others staggered back in dismay.
</p>
<p>
“Impossible,” declared Mr. Willing. “Surely
you are not barbarians.”
</p>
<p>
“The law of necessity must be obeyed,” replied
the captain.
</p>
<p>
He took his departure.
</p>
<p>
“The cold-blooded scoundrel,” declared Colonel
Ashton. “This is what we get for helping him to
escape.”
</p>
<p>
“And that is my fault,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there is no use talking about it now,” said
Dick. “It’s too late.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
</p>
<p>
An hour later the new crew began getting out
the boats, and all the passengers provided themselves
with life preservers. Fortunately, the
weather was calm and the sea smooth and there was
little likelihood of a storm at this time of year.
</p>
<p>
With everything in readiness, Captain Von
Blusen once more approached the Willing party,
and drew Mabel slightly to one side in spite of the
protests of the others.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Ashton,” he said, “in your cabin the other
day you spoke of your sympathies to the German
cause. Now I shall tell you something, for you
have done much for me. Advise the others to make
no attempt to reach Colon, should they be picked
up.”
</p>
<p>
“And why not?” demanded Shirley.
</p>
<p>
The captain hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there is no harm in telling you,” he said
at last. “Of course, you may not know that Germany
is trying to bring the United States into this
war on her side. We have at last found a way.
Just off Colon are several Japanese warships. We
shall near them unobserved, and signal by wireless
that a certain thing must be done, representing ourselves
as one of the Japanese battleships.
</p>
<p>
“Naturally, we shall be refused permission.
Now we have a new invention that would enable
us to destroy Colon from a distance, and in our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
message we shall threaten this unless the supposed
Japanese demand is granted. Do you understand?”
</p>
<p>
Mabel nodded her head slowly. She was beyond
words.
</p>
<p>
“And when the demand is refused,” continued the
captain “we shall use some of this new explosive.
That will mean war between Japan and the United
States, and therefore, England also, as she is Japan’s
ally. Do you see?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I see,” said Mabel quietly.
</p>
<p>
“And what do you think of the plan?”
</p>
<p>
“I think it is contemptible,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“But, but—” began the captain.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care to hear any more,” said Mabel.
“But you will not succeed, I am sure of that. You
can not succeed.”
</p>
<p>
She turned on her heel and made her way back
to the others, the captain standing as if rooted to
the deck as he stared after her.
</p>
<p>
Mabel turned the matter over in her mind. She
felt certain that the captain had been boasting, and
the more she thought it over the more she became
convinced of it. Therefore, she decided to say
nothing about it to the others.
</p>
<p>
Under the muzzles of the revolvers of the captors
of the big steamship, captain, officers, crew and
passengers now took their places in the small boats,
and were lowered over the side.
</p>
<p>
Each boat was well stocked with provisions and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
water, for the Germans had no mind to set their
prisoners adrift and let them starve or perish of
thirst.
</p>
<p>
The shore of Cuba was not far away, and, with
steady rowing by the men, it would be possible
for them to reach there within twelve hours. Besides,
there was always the chance they would be
picked up by a passing vessel.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the passenger list was not large.
The bulk of it had been made up of the men who
had later captured the ship. Therefore, officers,
passengers and crew included, there were not more
than three hundred set adrift.
</p>
<p>
The engine room crew had been impressed into
service by the Germans.
</p>
<p>
The Willing party found themselves in the boat
with the captain and perhaps a dozen other passengers.
As the boat struck the water, and the men
began to row away from the big steamship at the
captain’s command, Shirley and Mabel were badly
frightened.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the cheering words spoken by their
fathers, Dick and other male passengers, they did
not bear up very well. As they looked first in one
direction and then the other and saw nothing but
water, they broke into tears. The small boat looked
very small indeed to be at large upon the water.
</p>
<p>
Presently all the boats were launched, and rowed
some distance from the steamer. There they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
stopped as a sudden blast signified that the big
ship was about to get under way and leave them.
</p>
<p>
It began to grow dark. The electric lights aboard
the large vessel glowed suddenly, and slowly the
brilliantly lighted floating palace made off in the
gathering darkness.
</p>
<p>
As it went away and left them to the mercies
of the sea, cries of anguish, despair and condemnation
were hurled after the men who had thus
set the passengers and crew adrift. Women sobbed,
and men stood up in the boats and shook their
fists after the steamship <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
And then the great ship disappeared from sight.
The men in the small boats renewed their work at
the oars, and the boats moved toward the distant
Cuban coast.
</p>
<p>
Adding to the fearfulness of their condition,
darkness descended upon them like a pall.
</p>
<h2><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X.—COLON.</h2>
<p>
At a word from Mr. Willing, after several hours
of rowing, Shirley and Mabel cuddled up in their
end of the boat and tried to sleep; but this they
found impossible, and all through the night they
gazed out over the dark waters.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
Here and there the lights in the other boats were
visible, but before morning they had lost sight of
these. When the first faint streaks of dawn appeared
in the east there was not another boat to
be seen. They had become separated in the night.
</p>
<p>
The almost twenty passengers in the little craft
ate of the food that had been provided and drank
of the water. Thus refreshed, and with the sun
now appearing above the horizon, their predicament
did not seem as serious as it had during the
blackness of the night.
</p>
<p>
There was not an object in sight to break the
monotony of the water, and the boat rocked gently
on the easy swell of the sea. The men bent to the
oars again and sent the little craft skimming through
the water.
</p>
<p>
Came a cry from the man at the rudder, and
the eyes of the others followed his gaze toward
the distant horizon. They beheld a faint cloud in
the otherwise clear sky.
</p>
<p>
“Steamer!” cried the first man.
</p>
<p>
The cloud approached nearer and at last the outline
of a ship, appearing very small at that distance,
could be made out. It was headed on a
course that would bring it almost directly in the
path of the smaller boat.
</p>
<p>
As the hull of the vessel grew larger by its approach,
occasional cheers broke from the lips of
those in the little craft. So far it was impossible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
to tell whether the castaways had been sighted or
not; but as the big ship neared them—now scarcely
more than a mile away—the shrill blast of the
steamer’s whistle split the air. The small boat with
its passengers had been discovered. The passengers
raised another cheer.
</p>
<p>
Rapidly the large vessel bore down on them, and
the little craft bobbed swiftly toward it. At last
they came alongside.
</p>
<p>
“Ladies first!” cried the captain of the <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel were the first over the rail,
where they stood awaiting the arrival of the others.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing, Colonel Ashton and Dick were the
last to go aboard, and no sooner were the refugees
all on deck than the big vessel resumed her course.
The captain motioned them to his cabin.
</p>
<p>
The ship upon which they now found themselves
proved to be the <em>Reliance</em>, with a cargo of freight
from New Orleans for Colon.
</p>
<p>
This the captain explained when he learned where
the erstwhile refugees were bound.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t offer you the same accommodations
you had aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>,” he said, “but you
are welcome to the best we have.”
</p>
<p>
“And we are indeed glad to get it, captain,” Shirley
spoke up.
</p>
<p>
“No doubt, no doubt,” smiled the captain. “All
night in an open boat is no pleasure trip, even if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
this is the month of June,” and he ordered them
assigned quarters forward.
</p>
<p>
While by no means as large and pretentious as
those on the <em>Yucatan</em>, the cabins were nevertheless
clean and comfortable.
</p>
<p>
“We can thank our stars that we were fortunate
enough to be picked up so soon,” declared Dick.
</p>
<p>
“What can have become of the other boats?”
asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Probably reached the Cuban shore,” replied
Colonel Ashton. “We are doubtless the only ones
that lost our course. The others more than likely
stuck close together.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope they are all safe,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure they are,” returned her father.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Colonel Ashton, “the thing to be
considered is, what to do when we reach Colon.
Shall we take another steamer and continue our
course, or shall we turn about and go home?”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want to go home, Dad,” exclaimed
Shirley. “You won’t give up the trip to San Francisco,
will you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I think not,” was the reply. “We can replenish
our wardrobes in Colon sufficiently to get
to Frisco, and we can do the rest of our buying
there. No, we shall go on.”
</p>
<p>
The girls clapped their hands in delight. Both
had feared that the disaster might put an untimely
end to their summer vacation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose the Germans intend doing
with the <em>Yucatan</em>?” asked Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you heard the captain speak of a naval
base on the coast of Cuba. They probably will run
in there, put some big guns aboard and start out
on a privateering cruise. There have been a couple
of such German raiders, and they did considerable
damage to British merchant ships before they were
chased to the safety of internment in Newport
News.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess that is about what they plan to do,”
agreed Dick. “I’ll surely have one experience of
which to write when I get back to work.”
</p>
<p>
An hour later the party was gathered on deck,
when the captain of the <em>Yucatan</em> approached.
</p>
<p>
“The first thing I shall do is to report this to
General Fullaway, at Colon,” he declared.
</p>
<p>
“General Fullaway!” exclaimed Mr. Willing.
“You don’t mean General Hugh Fullaway?”
</p>
<p>
“The same,” replied the captain. “Do you know
him?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, rather,” replied Mr. Willing. “We were
schoolmates years ago, and have been close friends
since. He comes from my home town. I shall
look him up. But I didn’t know he was in command
in Colon.”
</p>
<p>
“He has only been recently put in command,”
was the reply. “I too know him well.”
</p>
<p>
The <em>Reliance</em> proved to be a very slow vessel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
and it was days before the city of Colon was
sighted.
</p>
<p>
At the entrance to the Panama Canal, Colon is a
very picturesque city. Since work on the canal
was begun, bringing thousands of Americans to the
country, it has been more or less metropolitan in
character, at the same time retaining its South
American atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel looked about with wonder as
they made their way through the dirty narrow
streets toward the hotel. This, however, they
found to be strictly up to date in all respects, and
they were soon installed in comfortable quarters.
</p>
<p>
Several hours later, Mr. Willing and Colonel
Ashton left the hotel, announcing that they were
going to pay their respects to General Fullaway.
They were back several hours later and informed
Shirley, Mabel and Dick that they were to dine
with the general in his quarters that night.
</p>
<p>
The girls were naturally excited at this prospect,
and spent most of the day in the purchase of suitable
garments. Dick, as well as Mr. Willing and
Colonel Ashton, also purchased more clothing to
take the place of what had been lost when they were
set adrift from the <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
General Fullaway had already heard the story
from the captain of the <em>Yucatan</em>, but supper over,
he desired to hear it once more from his guests.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing related their first meeting with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
German commander, who had introduced himself
as Henry Bristow when they had first met. He
told of the experience aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> while the
vessel was tied up at Jacksonville.
</p>
<p>
“You did wrong not to let the men take him,
no matter who they were,” was General Fullaway’s
verdict.
</p>
<p>
“I realize that now,” said Mr. Willing, “but who
could have suspected such a gigantic plot?”
</p>
<p>
“It was a gigantic plot,” agreed the general,
“and was carried out excellently. It must have
been well planned.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Bristow warned us not to come to Colon,
general,” spoke up Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“He did?” exclaimed the general in surprise.
“And why, pray?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he said it wasn’t safe,” replied Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Hm-m-m,” muttered the general, with a smile.
“And did he tell you why?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought not,” laughed the general.
</p>
<p>
“But he told me, general,” put in Mabel.
</p>
<p>
The others looked at the girl in surprise, but Mabel
bore up steadily under their scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, Mabel?” demanded Colonel
Ashton.
</p>
<p>
“You remember when he took me aside just before
we were set adrift, father?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, of course.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s when he told me, but it seemed so absurd
and impossible that I didn’t repeat it.”
</p>
<p>
“What was it, Miss Ashton?” asked General
Fullaway. “Will you tell us?”
</p>
<p>
“He said that Colon was in danger,” replied Mabel,
and she repeated the conversation she had had
with Captain Von Blusen aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
The others listened to her with breathless interest,
and there were exclamations of surprise when
she concluded.
</p>
<p>
“Absurd,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Impossible,” Colonel Ashton agreed.
</p>
<p>
“It would seem so, on the face of it,” said General
Fullaway, “and I suppose it is. It is true,
there are two Japanese warships off the entrance to
the Canal. They have not been allowed to pass
through because several German merchant vessels
are here. As soon as they have cleared, of course
we shall permit the Japs to go through.”
</p>
<p>
“And have the Japs objected to the delay?” asked
Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“They have indeed. They have demanded permission
to pass, which has been refused. That was
yesterday. But this tale of yours,” the general
turned to Mabel, “is incredible. I suppose the German
commander told it to you to frighten you.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose that was his reason,” Mabel agreed.
</p>
<p>
At this moment an orderly entered the room and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
gave a message to General Fullaway. The latter
read it, and then turned to Mabel again.
</p>
<p>
“It seems that your warning may bear fruit, after
all,” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, sir?” asked the girl eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, this message I have here,” said the general,
tapping the paper with his finger, “is, or seems
to be at least, a communication from the Japanese
commander. He says if his ships are not allowed
to pass through the canal to-morrow, he will destroy
the city of Colon!”
</p>
<h2><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI.—A WAR SCARE.</h2>
<p>
An air of intense anticipation pervaded the General’s
dining room.
</p>
<p>
Shirley finally broke the silence.
</p>
<p>
“And will you give them permission, general?”
she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Not without such instructions from Washington,”
was the reply. “My duties are clearly defined.
The Japanese ships cannot pass through the
canal while German merchantmen are in Colon harbor.
However, I am not at all sure the message
is from the Japs.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“You mean—the <em>Yucatan</em>,” asked Dick.
</p>
<p>
General Fullaway nodded.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t be at all surprised,” he replied quietly.
“I shall communicate with Washington at once, repeating
the story you have told me.”
</p>
<p>
He left the room, and returned in a few moments
with a slip of paper which he gave to the
officer who had brought the message.
</p>
<p>
“I should have a reply in a couple of hours,” he
told the others. “Would you care to wait and hear
the result?”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed we would,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
It was almost three hours later before the reply
came. General Fullaway read the message in silence,
then turned to the others.
</p>
<p>
“Your story must be true, Miss Ashton,” he
said. “Washington seems to have had some rumor
of it. The cruiser <em>Tennessee</em>, now stationed here,
has been ordered to take the <em>Yucatan</em> in charge.”
</p>
<p>
“Will there be a battle?” demanded Mabel anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“I do not think so. The <em>Yucatan</em>, armed though
she probably is by this time, would hardly be a
match for the <em>Tennessee</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could go with her,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“So do I,” agreed Dick.
</p>
<p>
General Fullaway was silent for some moments,
and then he said:
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it can be done. There will be no danger. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
don’t believe Captain Ainslee would object.
The <em>Tennessee</em> will not sail before morning. I shall
communicate with the captain immediately, and let
you know before morning. He will probably wish
to hear your story anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley, Mabel and the others returned to the
hotel, where they prepared for bed. Mr. Willing
was just about to retire when there was a knock
at the door. Opening it, a bellboy passed him a
message. It was from General Fullaway and said
that Captain Ainslee would expect the Willing party
aboard the <em>Tennessee</em> by 8 o’clock in the morning.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing called this piece of news to Dick
and the two girls, and all were greatly pleased.
</p>
<p>
“Just think of taking a trip on a warship!” exclaimed
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
All were about early the next morning and were
soon at the pier, where they found that a cutter
from the <em>Tennessee</em> had been sent to meet them.
Captain Ainslee himself greeted them as they made
their way over the side of the cruiser, and conducted
them to his cabin.
</p>
<p>
Here he left them for a few minutes while he
gave orders to get the ship under way. Directly
it began to move slowly through the waters of the
harbor, Captain Ainslee returned to the others.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” he said to Mabel, “I should be glad to
hear your story at first hand.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
Mabel repeated it and the captain listened attentively.
</p>
<p>
“To tell the truth,” he said, “this may be more
serious than I supposed. If Germany is bent upon
drawing the United States into the war, the <em>Yucatan</em>
may not surrender so easily.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean she is likely to fight?” asked
Mr. Willing in some alarm.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what I mean,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
And Captain Ainslee proved a good prophet.
</p>
<p>
It was well after noon when a cry from the
lookout brought all to deck.
</p>
<p>
“Steamer off the port bow!” it came.
</p>
<p>
The two girls rushed to the deck with the others.
The ships were still too far apart for those aboard
the cruiser to make out the other plainly, and the
wireless was immediately put in action.
</p>
<p>
“German converted cruiser <em>Kaiserin</em>!” came the
reply to Captain Ainslee’s message.
</p>
<p>
“I desire to come aboard you,” was the message
flashed back. “Heave to!”
</p>
<p>
The vessels drew nearer together, until at last
Captain Ainslee knew the other vessel was in range
of the <em>Tennessee’s</em> big guns.
</p>
<p>
“I was afraid he would run,” he explained.
“Now I shall make my demand for surrender. It’s
the <em>Yucatan</em> as you can see.”
</p>
<p>
The wireless was again put to working, and a
demand made upon the German to surrender.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
“What for?” came the question.
</p>
<p>
“Theft of United States vessel and threatening
destruction of Colon,” was the reply flashed back.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen must have realized that the
game was up. The <em>Yucatan</em> was brought quickly
about and turned to run.
</p>
<p>
“Clear for action!” came the command aboard
the <em>Tennessee</em>.
</p>
<p>
Shirley, Mabel and the others of the party found
themselves hurried back into the Captain’s private
cabin. There, through the port-hole, they watched
the preparations for battle.
</p>
<p>
The girls were greatly interested, and in spite of
the fact that they knew they were in danger, they
did not lose their coolness nor their courage.
</p>
<p>
Realizing that the passenger ship was probably
faster than the cruiser, Captain Ainslee wasted no
further time. The great forward turret gun spoke
with a roar, and Shirley and Mabel cried out at the
terrific noise.
</p>
<p>
They could watch the progress of the big shell
as it sped toward the <em>Yucatan</em>, where it kicked up
the water but a few yards to port. Again and
again the big gun spoke, and then there was a cheer
from the crew as a shell struck home.
</p>
<p>
Twice more the <em>Yucatan</em> was hit, and, while not
in a vital spot, her speed was suddenly reduced.
The <em>Tennessee</em> dashed on.
</p>
<p>
Then came the first shot from the enemy. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
spray flew high beside the cruiser as a shell struck
the water to larboard. Before she could fire again,
another shell from the <em>Tennessee’s</em> forward turret
gun crashed aboard her.
</p>
<p>
Then a white flag was run up the <em>Yucatan’s</em> masthead.
</p>
<p>
The firing aboard the <em>Tennessee</em> ceased, and the
cruiser bore down on the enemy.
</p>
<p>
Boats were hurriedly lowered, manned and darted
across the water to take charge of the <em>Yucatan</em>.
Half an hour later one of them returned bearing
the German commander and his officers. They
were conducted to the captain’s cabin immediately.
</p>
<p>
Henry Bristow—now Captain Von Blusen—at
first did not see the members of the Willing party
in the cabin, and he faced Captain Ainslee angrily.
</p>
<p>
“What is the meaning of this outrage?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
Captain Ainslee smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Come, come, captain,” he said. “Why this air
of wounded dignity? Surely you won’t attempt to
deny that you stole the <em>Yucatan</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I deny it,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“And I suppose you will also deny sending a message
to the commandant at Colon, threatening to
blow up the city?”
</p>
<p>
“That is absurd,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
Captain Ainslee motioned to Mabel, and she
stepped forward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you recognize this young lady, captain?”
demanded the commander of the <em>Tennessee</em>.
</p>
<p>
As the other’s eyes rested upon Mabel, he stepped
back in surprise and a look of genuine alarm passed
over his face. Then it grew dark. He was very
angry.
</p>
<p>
“So,” he exclaimed, “this is the way you show
your sympathy for Germany, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“What is Germany to me?” demanded Mabel
hotly. “I’m no German.”
</p>
<p>
“But you said—”
</p>
<p>
“I said that because I was angry at the time.
You have made trouble enough for us. I’m glad
you have been captured.”
</p>
<p>
“Further denial is useless, captain,” declared
Captain Ainslee. “I don’t believe you will dispute
the young lady’s words.”
</p>
<p>
Von Blusen turned away angrily, and his gaze
rested on Dick and the others for the first time.
</p>
<p>
“I see you are all here,” he said. Then to Dick,
“And I have not forgotten that I have a debt to
settle with you.”
</p>
<p>
He stepped quickly across the cabin and before
the others were aware of what he intended to do, he
struck Dick sharply across the face with the back
of his hand.
</p>
<p>
Dick was on his feet in an instant and would
have leaped upon his assailant had not the others
stayed him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
“Captain!” cried the commander of the <em>Tennessee</em>,
“you forget yourself! If that is the way
you Germans conduct yourselves no wonder the
whole world is against you. Another move like
that and I’ll have you put in irons!”
</p>
<p>
The German captain drew back but said nothing.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” continued Captain Ainslee, “I would like
to know the meaning of this affair you have been
mixed up in. Is Germany seeking war with the
United States?”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” was the reply. “The United States
has been against us, why shouldn’t we be against
her?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s your own evil consciences that make you
think that,” replied Captain Ainslee. “The United
States has been strictly neutral in this war. But
an accounting for this will be demanded of the
Kaiser.”
</p>
<p>
“And he’ll give it,” thundered the captain, striking
the table with his fist. “He’ll give it!”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe he will, but he’ll be sorry,” declared Shirley,
who could keep quiet no longer. “Uncle Sam
will stand no foolishness from the Kaiser.”
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen smiled at her scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“We shall come over here some day and take
the United States,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll be surprised when you try it,” said Shirley
angrily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
</p>
<p>
“Shirley!” exclaimed Mr. Willing. “Keep
quiet!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care,” cried Shirley. “Anybody knows
Uncle Sam can whip Germany, and all the rest of
them, too, for that matter.”
</p>
<p>
Again Mr. Willing would have enjoined the girl
to silence, but Captain Ainslee stayed him with uplifted
hand.
</p>
<p>
“Let her alone,” he chuckled. “That is the spirit
I like to see!”
</p>
<h2><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII.—ABOARD THE YUCATAN.</h2>
<p>
The <em>Tennessee</em> returned immediately to Colon,
followed by the <em>Yucatan</em>, now manned by a crew
of American sailors. The run was made quickly,
and darkness had just descended when the ships
came to anchor and the Willing party made their
way ashore and returned to their hotel.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen and the members of his
crew were immediately turned over to the Canal
Zone authorities, pending orders from Washington.
</p>
<p>
What was the surprise of Shirley and the others,
upon reaching the hotel, to find there others of the
passengers who had been set adrift when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
<em>Yucatan</em> was captured by the German conspirators.
They greeted each other warmly.
</p>
<p>
“We were picked up by a steamer and just
reached here this afternoon,” one of the women
passengers explained to Shirley and Mabel. “We
had about given you up for lost. The rest of us
are all here.”
</p>
<p>
“And so is the <em>Yucatan</em>,” replied Shirley.
</p>
<p>
In response to exclamations of astonishment, she
related the story of the recapture of the vessel.
</p>
<p>
“Then we shall be allowed to continue our trip,
I suppose,” remarked one of the passengers.
</p>
<p>
“Unless the government decides to hold on to
the steamer,” said another.
</p>
<p>
But the government did not, and the following
day the full crew of the <em>Yucatan</em> was once more
aboard the vessel, and it was announced that she
would resume her journey the following morning.
</p>
<p>
The day was spent by most of the passengers
viewing the sights of interest in the canal zone
and in the city of Colon proper.
</p>
<p>
A few words concerning the Panama Canal will
not be amiss here.
</p>
<p>
The canal was opened to smaller vessels on August
5, 1914, but the official opening did not take
place until much later, being attended with elaborate
ceremonies.
</p>
<p>
The canal is about fifty miles in length from deep
water in the Caribbean Sea to deep water in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
Pacific Ocean. It ranges in width from 300 to
1,000 feet with an average bottom width of almost
700 feet. The Gatun dam along its crest is 8,000
feet long.
</p>
<p>
The construction of the canal is considered one
of the greatest feats of engineering of all time
and was accomplished at a tremendous cost. The
land was secured by treaty from Colombia at great
expense and resulted in considerable trouble between
the United States and the South American
republic.
</p>
<p>
It is provided by treaties that the canal shall
be open to the vessels of all nations, merchantmen,
or ships of war, in times of war as well in
times of peace; but strict rules of neutrality have
been provided for the passage of war vessels.
</p>
<p>
All this Mr. Willing explained to the others during
the day. With the coming of night, the passengers
began to go aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> for the ship
was to sail at an early hour and it was deemed advisable
to be aboard the night before.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, when Shirley and Mabel arose and
went on deck, the <em>Yucatan</em> already had started its
passage through the canal. The girls stood upon
the upper deck aft and looked about with interest;
but after an hour of this they grew tired and went
down to breakfast.
</p>
<p>
The passage of the canal would require about
ten hours and Shirley remarked to Mabel that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
would be glad when they were on the Pacific and
sailing up the coast.
</p>
<p>
“And so will I,” agreed Mabel. “Of course it
is nice to see all these things, but they don’t interest
me a whole lot.”
</p>
<p>
“I feel the same way. To tell the truth I shall
be glad to get to San Francisco. From what I
have heard, the Exposition must be beautiful.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed it must. By the way, I wonder what
will be done with Henry Bristow—I mean Captain
Von Blusen?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” replied Shirley. “However, I
suppose he will be taken to Washington.”
</p>
<p>
“He seemed a very nice young man. I wouldn’t
have thought he was a German.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I suppose there are nice Germans as well
as any other kind,” replied Shirley with a laugh.
“But I wonder why they took such chances?”
</p>
<p>
“Orders, I reckon. The Germans have shown
great daring and bravery in this war.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say they have. I wonder if the United
States will be drawn into the war.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness gracious! I hope not! Why,
Daddy might have to go.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh I guess not,” laughed Shirley. “He is too
old for that, except as a last resort.”
</p>
<p>
“But Dick might have to go.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so; but I don’t think there will be any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
war between the United States and Germany. We
could whip them easily.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose the Germans think they could whip
us just as well as we believe we can whip them.”
</p>
<p>
“But I know we can whip them.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m not so sure. But one thing is certain,
we won’t have to go to war. That’s the advantage
of being a girl.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh I don’t know,” said Shirley, “I believe I
would like to go.”
</p>
<p>
“Not for me,” declared Mabel. “Still, I might
be willing to go as a Red Cross nurse.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I meant,” replied Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing, Colonel Ashton and Dick now
joined them, and they discussed recent happenings.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t suppose there is any chance of Von
Blusen getting away, sir?” asked Dick of Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing looked at him and smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Afraid he’ll come after you?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“No, not exactly sir,” replied Dick. “I just
wondered, that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think there is. I’m sure I don’t want
to be on the same ship with him again. He’ll
make mischief wherever he is.”
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Willing was to be disappointed in this
wish, as it turned out later.
</p>
<p>
Noon came and passed and still the big steamship
was in the canal; but with the coming of the supper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
hour the Pacific ocean became visible in the
distance.
</p>
<p>
It was the first time that Dick, Shirley or Mabel
had seen the Pacific, and they stared ahead for
a long time.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see as it looks any different from the
Atlantic,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“What did you expect?” asked Mabel. “Think
you were going to see the name on it?”
</p>
<p>
“Not exactly. I don’t know just what I expected,
but I thought it would look different.”
</p>
<p>
The others laughed.
</p>
<p>
“It might feel a little different in case a big
storm came up,” said Dick.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to be in a storm on any water,”
declared Shirley with decision.
</p>
<p>
“I should say not,” Mabel agreed. “A storm
is bad enough with lots of dry land under your
feet.”
</p>
<p>
The sun was just disappearing below the horizon
when the <em>Yucatan</em> at last stuck her nose into the
waters of the Pacific ocean.
</p>
<p>
“Well, here we are in the Pacific at last,” said
Colonel Ashton. “Do you feel any difference,
Shirley?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit,” replied the girl with a smile.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing looked at the sky.
</p>
<p>
“I guess there will be no storm on this trip,” he
said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later all went below to supper.
</p>
<p>
They had almost finished a delightful meal when
their attention was attracted by the sound of a
scuffle on deck. All rushed hastily up.
</p>
<p>
There, struggling with a knot of sailors, was a
single man. His back was turned to the girls as
they made their way on deck, and at first they did
not recognize him.
</p>
<p>
He was giving a good account of himself, striking
out with such force and skill as gave evidence
of much training in the use of his fists; but the
sailors were too many for him, and he was at last
overpowered and thrown to the deck.
</p>
<p>
Rude hands jerked him to his feet and it was
then that Shirley and Mabel obtained their first look
at his face.
</p>
<p>
Shirley started back with a cry of utter amazement.
Then a name leaped to her lips, and was
repeated by all the passengers within sight.
</p>
<p>
“Captain Von Blusen!”
</p>
<p>
“How in the world did he get here?” exclaimed
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t imagine,” declared Mabel, staring with
open mouth.
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson of the <em>Yucatan</em> now hastened
down from the bridge and confronted the prisoner.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing on my ship and how did
you get here?” he demanded angrily.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen smiled at him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
“I just escaped, that’s all,” he replied. “You
treated me so well before that I thought I would
take passage with you. Besides it was the least
likely place I would be looked for.”
</p>
<p>
“But how did you escape?” demanded the captain.
</p>
<p>
“That would be telling,” was the reply, and the
young man smiled tantalizingly. “However, it
will do no harm to say that I have good friends in
Colon.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll guarantee you won’t do any more
harm aboard my ship,” declared the captain angrily.
</p>
<p>
He turned to his first officer. “Have him put
in irons!”
</p>
<p>
“Very good, sir,” replied the first officer, and advanced
toward the prisoner.
</p>
<p>
“One moment,” said the latter drawing himself
up. “I did not come here with any ill motive,”
still addressing the captain, “and I desire to give my
parole.”
</p>
<p>
“And what good is your parole?” demanded
Captain Anderson.
</p>
<p>
“One gentleman is always ready to accept the
word of another gentleman,” said Von Blusen
slowly. “I give my word to make no attempt to
escape.”
</p>
<p>
The captain hesitated, then waved an arm expressively.
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” he said. “Your parole is accepted.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
He returned to the bridge, and the sailors released
Von Blusen. The latter walked over to
where the Willing party were gathered.
</p>
<p>
“Well, here I am again,” he said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“I see you are,” replied Mabel, and deliberately
turned her back on him.
</p>
<p>
The young man’s face became red. He turned
on his heel and walked off without another word.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII.—ASHORE IN COSTA RICA.</h2>
<p>
The steamship <em>Yucatan</em> was swinging slowly into
a little harbor. Land, visible for the first time
since leaving the Panama Canal, was now close at
hand.
</p>
<p>
“What place is this?” asked Shirley of Dick,
who stood forward gazing over the rail by her
side.
</p>
<p>
Dick consulted his guide book, remarking: “I
can’t remember the name of these outlandish
places.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s Punta Arenas,” he said at last, looking up.
“Costa Rica, you know,” he added in explanation.
</p>
<p>
“And what are we putting in here for?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to ask the captain about that,” replied
Dick. “It’s too deep for me.”
</p>
<p>
The vessel came to anchor some distance from
shore. It was announced that the ship would lay
there for several hours, and the captain gave notice
that those desiring to land would be taken off
in the small boats.
</p>
<p>
Shirley immediately announced her intention of
being one of the landing party, and loath to let
the girl go alone, Mr. Willing and the others also
determined to go ashore.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later found them strolling about
the dirty looking narrow streets of the little town.
</p>
<p>
Poorly-dressed natives, men, women and children,
eyed them queerly as they walked along, the
latter following them for blocks begging for money.
Shirley would have given one of the children a
piece of silver but for the first officer of the ship,
who stayed her.
</p>
<p>
“Give money to one of them and the rest will
follow you forever,” he explained.
</p>
<p>
“But they look so dirty and hungry,” protested
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps they are,” was the officer’s reply, “but
take no chances with them.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley followed his advice, as did the others of
the party, and the dirty native children soon let
them alone. When the party started back, however, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
children trailed them once more, begging
piteously for money.
</p>
<p>
At the wharf Shirley, unheeding the advice of
the officer, turned and tossed a silver quarter toward
them.
</p>
<p>
Instantly the place became a scene of wild confusion.
There was a scramble as boys and girls
dived headlong for the piece of silver. Loud cries
filled the air.
</p>
<p>
A little girl raised up with the piece of money
clutched tightly in her hand and started to run.
But the others were upon her in an instant, and
threw her to the ground, striking and clawing as
they tried to take the quarter away from her.
</p>
<p>
Shirley looked at the disorder she had caused
in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” she exclaimed. “I had no idea
they were so savage.”
</p>
<p>
She watched the struggle.
</p>
<p>
Now a boy had secured the quarter and tried to
escape with it. But he fared no better than had
the girl, and soon was beneath the pile of struggling
bodies. The children fought savagely, biting,
screaming, kicking and scratching.
</p>
<p>
The party from the steamship watched with interest.
</p>
<p>
“See what you did, Shirley,” cried Mabel. “Just
watch them fight.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“I won’t do it again,” declared Shirley. “Some
of them will be badly hurt.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment a newcomer appeared upon the
scene. He walked slowly, and plainly was in no
particular hurry. Shirley glanced at him curiously.
</p>
<p>
He was attired in a dark blue uniform. A revolver
and sword hung at his side. He was short
but stout, and a black mustache curled fiercely upward.
</p>
<p>
He was just what Shirley took him to be, an officer
of the Costa Rican army.
</p>
<p>
He advanced into the mass of struggling children
and pushed the combatants aside without ceremony.
As they looked up and perceived him, the fighters
turned and fled.
</p>
<p>
The sight was indeed comical and Shirley and
all the others laughed long and loud.
</p>
<p>
One little boy, before taking to his heels, stooped
quickly and picked up the quarter, which had rolled
a short distance away. But even as he started to
run, the native officer reached out a hand and caught
him by the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
In vain did the boy struggle to free himself, biting
and kicking. He was no match for the man,
and at last he dropped the piece of silver. The officer
then released him and looked around.
</p>
<p>
While the Americans still watched him he
stooped, picked up the quarter, turned it over in
his hand once or twice, spun it in the air, caught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
it as it came down and thrust it in his pocket.
Then, without a glance to right or left, he turned
and stalked away.
</p>
<p>
“There!” exclaimed the ship’s officer, “you can
see what has happened to your quarter. It’s what
happens to most of those thrown to the children by
tourists.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s an outrage!” declared Shirley. “I wouldn’t
have given him anything. Isn’t there something we
can do about it?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a thing,” was the reply. “It is legitimate
graft. But watch, now, you’ll see what the little
folks do.”
</p>
<p>
As the native officer continued to swagger along,
from behind houses and from down streets a hail
of rocks and stones dropped upon him. The children,
divided in the fight for the quarter, had joined
forces against this common enemy and were pelting
him vigorously.
</p>
<p>
“Good!” exclaimed Mabel. “I am glad of it.
I hope they hurt him, the big coward.”
</p>
<p>
The native officer stopped and glared around angrily
at his small assailants for a moment, while
the rocks and stones fell on him faster than before.
One struck him in the face. This was too much
for his courage. He took to his heels, and with
the mob of children in close pursuit, was soon lost
to sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
</p>
<p>
“I hope they get him,” declared Shirley vehemently.
</p>
<p>
“They won’t, though,” replied the officer of the
<em>Yucatan</em>. “If he were to turn on them they’d stop
and, from a safe place, continue their bombardment.
He’ll find shelter some place.”
</p>
<p>
Before they could return to the launch which
would take them back to the ship, the swarm of
children again came into view, rushing for them.
</p>
<p>
“Quick!” cried the officer, “into the boat.
They’ll run right over us. They’ve caught a sight
of silver and they won’t let us alone until we give
them some, or until we are out of reach.”
</p>
<p>
He hustled the others toward the small boat at
a run, and succeeded in getting them in before the
native children reached the water’s edge. Then
the boat put off for the ship.
</p>
<p>
A cry of anger went up from the shore.
</p>
<p>
“Duck!” cried the officer, himself taking his
place in the stern and grasping the rudder.
</p>
<p>
His warning came not a moment too soon.
</p>
<p>
A shower of missiles, hurled with unerring aim,
fell upon the little craft. Disappointed in their
quest, the native children were now bent on revenge.
</p>
<p>
As fast as they could pick them up and throw,
rocks went skimming across the water, falling on
both sides, and in front and behind the boat. Several
dropped aboard.
</p>
<p>
One, in falling, just skimmed the back of Shirley’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
head as she stooped over in the boat. Dick
immediately squeezed in behind her, and another,
thrown with unerring aim, carried away his hat.
Fortunately however, this broke the force of the
stone, and it fell to the bottom of the boat without
doing any further damage.
</p>
<p>
The boat was drawing out of danger now, and
the occupants sat up again and drew breaths of
relief. Only the stronger of the tots could now
reach them with their missiles, and the distance
was too great for accurate throwing, so those in
the boats felt perfectly safe.
</p>
<p>
Upon the shore the crowd of native boys and
girls gave vent to cries of rage at thus being deprived
of their revenge. They danced about excitedly
and waved their hands in angry gestures.
</p>
<p>
At this juncture another native officer hove in
sight, and the crowd turned on him. Again rocks,
stones and other weapons came into play as the
children turned upon him to vent their wrath. For
a moment the officer seemed on the point of charging
into the crowd, then changed his mind, wheeled
on his heel and took to flight. The young ones
gave chase, their shouts and cries carrying across
the water to the occupants of the boat.
</p>
<p>
“Well!” exclaimed Shirley, now that they were
out of harm’s way at last, “they are vicious little
things, aren’t they?”
</p>
<p>
“Rather,” replied the officer dryly. “If a person fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
into their hands it would go hard with
him.”
</p>
<p>
“But what makes them so fierce?” asked Mabel,
greatly interested.
</p>
<p>
“That’s hard to say. However, it probably is
because they are half starved and look upon the
whole world as a common foe. More than one
tourist has received rough treatment at their hands.”
</p>
<p>
“And will they attack any one like that?” asked
Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Not unless he shows money,” was the reply.
“That is the remarkable part about it. No matter
how much a man may have in his pocket they will
not attack him unless they catch sight of silver or
gold. One glimpse of it, however, seems to drive
them wild.”
</p>
<p>
The officer gave his attention to the boat for a
moment, and then continued:
</p>
<p>
“Another thing, as you have just observed.
They will fight each other, but let a third party
interfere and they will all jump on him.”
</p>
<p>
“Just like a quarrel between a man and his wife,
eh?” asked Mr. Willing with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. They’re a queer lot, and you will find
them about the same in all Central and South
American countries.”
</p>
<p>
The small boat now rubbed gently against the
side of the <em>Yucatan</em> and the passengers scrambled
up the ladder to the deck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“We were lucky to get out of that with whole
skins,” declared Shirley, when all once more stood
on deck.
</p>
<p>
“I should say we were,” agreed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps this experience will teach you to heed
the advice of others, daughter,” said Mr. Willing
dryly.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t try and play the good Samaritan to native
children any more, Dad,” said Shirley smiling.
</p>
<p>
A long blast from the ship’s whistle, followed by
the clanking of chains as the anchor was drawn in,
the vibrations of the engines became noticeable,
and, with her nose pointed to the open sea, the
steamship <em>Yucatan</em> resumed her journey.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV.—U. S. S. PRAIRIE.</h2>
<p>
“Steamship off the port bow, sir!”
</p>
<p>
It was the cry of the lookout.
</p>
<p>
All eyes were turned in the direction indicated.
There, showing dimly through the gathering darkness,
steamed a dark gray shape. Another glance
from the lookout was enough to convince him of
the vessel’s identity.
</p>
<p>
“United States cruiser, sir!” came his call.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can you make her out?” asked the captain’s
voice from the bridge.
</p>
<p>
The lookout was silent for several minutes, and
then called back:
</p>
<p>
“Cruiser <em>Prairie</em>, sir.”
</p>
<p>
There was a muttered ejaculation from the captain.
Shirley, standing near, caught the words:
</p>
<p>
“Wonder what she’s doing in these waters? She
was in Bluefields the last I heard of her. Must be
trouble of some kind or she wouldn’t be here.”
</p>
<p>
The two ships exchanged messages, the nature
of which were unknown to the passengers, however.
Both continued on their course.
</p>
<p>
Morning showed to the passengers the cruiser
proceeding ahead of them. All day the two ships
retained their relative positions and when night
came on they were unchanged.
</p>
<p>
When Shirley awoke the following morning the
<em>Yucatan</em> was stationary. Shirley and Mabel
dressed quickly and went on deck. There they
found that they were in a little harbor. Shirley
asked a question of one of the other passengers.
</p>
<p>
“Where are we?”
</p>
<p>
“Port of Corinto, Nicaragua,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
At this moment a small boat was just about to be
lowered. Shirley and Mabel rushed up to the first
officer, who was in command of it.
</p>
<p>
“Can we go with you?” she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
</p>
<p>
The officer hesitated, then: “I see no reason
why you cannot,” with a smile. “Jump in.”
</p>
<p>
The girls obeyed and a few moments later were
being rowed toward the not-far-distant shore.
There the boat drew up at the wharf, and, signalling
to the girls to accompany him if they so desired,
the officer leaped lightly ashore and lent them
a helping hand. The sailors were ordered to await
his return.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“American consulate,” was the reply. “There
has been some trouble here, and Captain Anderson
has sent me to find out what it's all about.”
</p>
<p>
At the consulate Shirley and Mabel remained outside,
while the first officer was closeted with the
consul.
</p>
<p>
“We might as well walk around a bit,” Shirley
decided. “There is no telling how long he may
remain there.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel was nothing loath, and they made their
way to the street. Here they walked along slowly,
looking curiously at the native Nicaraguans and
the queer buildings, all of old Spanish architecture
and design.
</p>
<p>
“None of this for me,” was Shirley’s decision
half an hour later.
</p>
<p>
“Nor me,” agreed Mabel. “I want to live in
civilization.”
</p>
<p>
Unconsciously the girls had wandered further
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
from the consulate than they realized, and as they
were on the point of turning back Mabel caught
sight of a familiar figure.
</p>
<p>
“Captain Von Blusen!” she exclaimed, catching
Shirley by the arm.
</p>
<p>
Shirley caught her breath and gazed in the direction
Mabel pointed.
</p>
<p>
It was true. There, slinking along furtively,
was the gallant captain and he was walking along
at a rapid rate.
</p>
<p>
“Wonder where he is going and why he’s in such
a hurry?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” returned Shirley, “but I’ll warrant
he is up to no good.”
</p>
<p>
“But he has given his parole to make no attempt
to escape.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t imagine he’ll set much store by that if
he sees a good opportunity to get away.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley would have continued her way back, but
Mabel said:
</p>
<p>
“Wait a moment, Shirley. Perhaps, by following
him a bit, we may learn something useful.
What do you say?”
</p>
<p>
For a moment Shirley hesitated, but for a moment
only.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we can,” she said then. “There can
be no danger if we keep out of sight. Come on.”
</p>
<p>
The German was now some distance ahead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
them, and taking care to avoid being seen should
he turn suddenly, the girls followed him.
</p>
<p>
But apparently Captain Von Blusen had no idea
that he would be followed. He strode rapidly along
and not once did he turn his head.
</p>
<p>
“He must have been here before,” Shirley decided.
“He seems to know where he is going.”
</p>
<p>
For another ten minutes they followed him, and
then Shirley halted.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid we had better go back,” she said.
“We may get lost.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh I guess not,” declared Mabel. “And besides
we have plenty of time. The ship will probably
stay here most of the day. Come on, Shirley.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley allowed herself to be led along.
</p>
<p>
They had now approached the outskirts of the
little town, and the young German struck off
through a clump of trees. At the edge of these
Shirley stopped abruptly.
</p>
<p>
“We won’t follow him any further,” she said
decisively. “It might be dangerous.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you are right,” agreed Mabel. “I wish
he had stayed where we could keep track of him.”
</p>
<p>
“So do I. But he didn’t. We had better be
getting back.”
</p>
<p>
They turned and started to retrace their footsteps,
but even as they did so the footsteps of a
large body of men came toward them. They were
not yet in sight, but the men were coming right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
down the street through which the girls must go
on their way back.
</p>
<p>
Mabel looked at Shirley in alarm.
</p>
<p>
“What shall we do?” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll just have to put on a bold face and walk
right along,” declared Shirley. “Come.”
</p>
<p>
She started out slowly, Mabel walking by her
side.
</p>
<p>
A moment later there appeared ahead of them,
advancing at a rapid march, a body of armed men.
Shirley and Mabel shrank close to the side of the
street to give the marchers as much room as possible.
</p>
<p>
At first it seemed the girls would get by without
trouble, for the first troop had passed them, paying
no attention to their presence.
</p>
<p>
But as the officer in command of the troop came
abreast of them, a command suddenly rang out:
</p>
<p>
“Halt!”
</p>
<p>
The troop stopped abruptly, and grounded their
arms. Shirley and Mabel also paused, as they believed
the words were meant for them. Then, seeing
the soldiers pause, they moved on again. But
again came the cry of “Halt.”
</p>
<p>
The girls halted in their tracks.
</p>
<p>
The commander, whom they perceived was a
man well along toward seventy, but who nevertheless
walked perfectly erect and who looked very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
imposing in his bright military uniform, advanced
toward them.
</p>
<p>
“What are you young ladies doing here?” he
asked courteously, in English.
</p>
<p>
“We were just walking about the city, sir,” replied
Shirley, her voice trembling somewhat in spite
of the efforts she made to keep it steady.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you come from?”
</p>
<p>
“Steamship in the harbor, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean the cruiser?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir,” replied Mabel. “The passenger
steamer, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“H-m-mm-m,” muttered the officer.
</p>
<p>
Before he could speak further there came, from
the town, the sound of more rapidly approaching
footsteps.
</p>
<p>
“Come with me,” cried the Nicaraguan officer
quickly, “if you go on you will be hurt. Come
quickly.”
</p>
<p>
He urged his men on with a sharp command.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel hung back.
</p>
<p>
“Quick!” cried the general again. “There will
be fighting here in a few minutes, and if you are in
the way you are likely to be hurt.”
</p>
<p>
A squad of men, at his command, surrounded
the two girls, and they were forced to go along
whether or no.
</p>
<p>
The troop dashed quickly for the shelter of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
woods in which the girls had seen Captain Von
Blusen disappear a few moments before.
</p>
<p>
Once in the shelter of the trees, the officer in
command gave several sharp orders, and the troop
divided into three parts. Then they flitted rapidly
further in among the trees.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel, now badly frightened, found
themselves with the commanding officer’s section.
They could see that they were bearing off to the
right and several times would have spoken, but the
officer silenced them with a gesture.
</p>
<p>
“I shall answer your questions later,” he said
once.
</p>
<p>
Although the girls did not know just what was
the matter, they realized that the Nicaraguans were
fleeing from another, and, supposedly, a larger body
of men.
</p>
<p>
“I hope they overtake us. I want to get back to
Dad,” cried Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“And I hope they don’t,” exclaimed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Shirley!”
</p>
<p>
“I mean it. If they do overtake us it may mean
a battle, and then we would be in danger. As
long as we keep away from them we are safe. Besides,
Dad will find us some way. Our fathers and
Dick won’t permit us to be carried off.”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon you are right, Shirley,” Mabel agreed
finally. “Besides, there is an American cruiser
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
near. They’ll have the bluejackets out searching
for us.”
</p>
<p>
“And they will find us, too,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I hope they hurry up and come,” exclaimed
Shirley. “I’m badly frightened, but I don’t want
to show it. The thing to do is to make the officer
think we are not a bit scared.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll try,” said Mabel calmly.
</p>
<p>
For an hour they continued on their way, and
then suddenly the force began to increase as men
appeared from other directions and joined the main
body.
</p>
<p>
Although the girls did not know it, these were the
same men who had scattered at the first sign of pursuit.
They had made a detour to throw the pursuers
off the track.
</p>
<p>
At last the commander called a halt. Then he
approached the two girls.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I had better explain why I insisted on
your coming with us,” he said with a pleasant smile.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV.—AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</h2>
<p>
“If you please,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
The officer gazed at both girls admiringly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
“You take it coolly enough,” he declared. “Many
in your places would be badly frightened.”
</p>
<p>
“Surely there is nothing to be afraid of,” said
Mabel, determined to show as bold a front as possible.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said the officer, “there isn’t.” He looked
at them closely. “I wonder if either of you happen
to know who I am?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
Shirley shook her head negatively.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure I don’t,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Then I must introduce myself,” was the reply.
“I am General Pedro Garcia, President of the republic
of Nicaragua.”
</p>
<p>
Both girls looked at him in the utmost surprise.
</p>
<p>
“You may well be surprised,” said the general, a
touch of bitterness in his tone, it seemed to Shirley,
“and no doubt you are to see the President of
the country in such a predicament?”
</p>
<p>
Shirley didn’t know much about Nicaragua, but
she decided she might as well agree with him, as
he seemed to expect it.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“And I am surprised to find myself in such a position,”
said the President. “I shall explain. With
my men I am fleeing from the revolutionists.”
</p>
<p>
“Revolutionists?” echoed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. I was in Corinto with some of my
army for diplomatic purposes. While absent from
Managua there was an uprising. It seems to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
been well planned, for it broke out in all parts of
the republic at once, even here in Corinto.”
</p>
<p>
“I was surprised with my men this morning and
was forced to flee. That’s about all there is to it.”
</p>
<p>
“But why did you bring us with you?” demanded
Shirley. “Why didn’t you allow us to return to
our ship.”
</p>
<p>
“Because you might never have reached there,”
replied the President quietly. “You would probably
have fallen into the hands of the revolutionists.
While you are with me you are safe.”
</p>
<p>
There was no doubting the sincerity in the President’s
voice, and both girls unconsciously breathed
easier.
</p>
<p>
“Besides,” continued the general, “your presence
may help me a bit.”
</p>
<p>
“In what way sir?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there is a United States cruiser in Corinto
harbor. When you are missed the natural supposition
will be that you have fallen into the hands of
the revolutionists. The U. S. sailors will be sent
after you, and will be likely to attack my foes.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” said Shirley with a slight smile. “Then
you did not save us from an altogether unselfish
motive.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear young ladies, consider,” said the President,
“it is better for both of us.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t doubt you, sir,” replied Shirley; “but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
just the same I would rather be safe aboard our
ship.”
</p>
<p>
“And so you shall be, if it is within my power
to put you there,” declared the President of Nicaragua
warmly.
</p>
<p>
At this moment two of the general’s troopers approached,
dragging a third man between them.
Shirley and Mabel fell back a few feet.
</p>
<p>
“Hello! Who have we here?” demanded President
Garcia.
</p>
<p>
“Prisoner, sir,” replied one of the men.
</p>
<p>
“Release him,” said the President. “I shall talk
to him myself. Who are you, and what are you doing
here?” he demanded sharply.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel both started at the sound of
the prisoner’s voice. He was none other than Captain
von Blusen.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Captain von Blusen, of the German navy,”
was the reply. “I have been held prisoner aboard
an American ship, and have but recently escaped.
I am seeking Colonel Hernandez.”
</p>
<p>
“Hernandez!” exclaimed President Garcia, stepping
back in surprise. “The leader of the revolutionists!”
</p>
<p>
“And may I ask your name, sir?” said Captain
von Blusen.
</p>
<p>
“I,” said the general, “am the President of
Nicaragua.”
</p>
<p>
The prisoner gave vent to a long whistle and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
look of dismay passed over his face. It was gone
in a moment, however, and he turned to the President
with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“I am fortunate in finding you, sir,” he said. “I
am authorized by my government to make you a
proposition.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I shall hear it,” said the President.
</p>
<p>
“I am authorized to offer you a large sum of
money for the privilege of establishing a German
naval base on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua.”
</p>
<p>
“Enough!” cried the general with a wave of his
hand. “It shall not be done if I can prevent it.
Germany indeed. Were I able, I myself should
draw a sword against her. You will find no German
sympathy in these parts.”
</p>
<p>
Captain von Blusen bowed his head. He said
nothing further on the subject.
</p>
<p>
“What will you do with me?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“I shall hold you until the rebels have been put
down,” was the reply. “Then you shall be released.
I wouldn’t trust you now.”
</p>
<p>
He signalled two of his men and the young German
officer was led away between them.
</p>
<p>
At this moment another officer rushed up to the
general.
</p>
<p>
“Our presence has been discovered, sir,” he
gasped. “The enemy is approaching.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel now perceived that the President
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
of the Republic of Nicaragua, in spite of his
advanced years, was a man of action.
</p>
<p>
He turned rapidly from one to another of his
officers, and these dashed quickly away. A moment
later the few troops began to move, and the girls
realized that President Garcia had taken some steps
to offset the advance of the revolutionists.
</p>
<p>
They found themselves going along with the
troops.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! I wish we were back on the
ship,” exclaimed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t wish it any more than I do,” declared
Mabel. “I am more frightened than you are.
Suppose there should be a battle. What would happen
to us?”
</p>
<p>
Shirley shrugged her shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“You know as much about it as I do,” she made
answer.
</p>
<p>
Mabel looked at her in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Shirley Willing!” she exclaimed. “Aren’t
you afraid? I am scared half to death.”
</p>
<p>
“I am just as badly frightened as you are,” declared
Shirley. “I may not look it, but I am.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe you are frightened at all,” said
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the seriousness of the situation and her
declaration that she was badly frightened, Shirley
was forced to smile at her friend’s words.
</p>
<p>
“Well, perhaps I’m not so awfully scared,” she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
confessed. “I’m anxious to see what is going to
happen.”
</p>
<p>
“I know what is going to happen,” was the reply.
“We are going to get hurt!”
</p>
<p>
Mabel broke down and began to cry.
</p>
<p>
Shirley took her chum gently in her arms, and
stroked her hair.
</p>
<p>
“There, there!” she said. “Stop crying. No one
is going to hurt us. You are just overwrought,
that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
“I just know we are going to be shot—and—and
killed,” sobbed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense,” said Shirley sharply. “Look up now
and stop that crying. We are perfectly safe. Stop
crying.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel looked up suddenly at the sharpness in her
chum’s tone, but her tears soon were dried away.
Shirley, in speaking as she had, had done the best
thing possible. She had realized that it was time
for sharp words and not for sympathy.
</p>
<p>
After a march of perhaps a half hour, President
Garcia called another halt, and then summoned his
officers into consultation.
</p>
<p>
The two girls stood close, but they could not make
out what was being said. At length the general
dismissed his officers with a gesture, and as they
scattered to their respective posts, the general approached
the two girls.
</p>
<p>
“We are going to make a sharp turn to the south
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
here,” he said quietly, “and then we shall move
back and engage the enemy. That will put you
safely behind us. Now, if I were you, I would bear
off slightly to the right, and then go straight ahead.
In that way you will be out of danger. If the firing
comes closer to you, make another wide detour,
turn about and try to make your way back to the
ship. But I would not do that until after the battle
ceases.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir,” said Shirley. “We shall do
as you suggest. We thank you for your thoughtfulness
in keeping us from falling into the hands of
the revolutionists. May you come through the battle
unharmed, and may you be successful.”
</p>
<p>
She extended her hand, and the President bent
over it gravely.
</p>
<p>
“I thank you for your good wishes,” he said
quietly.
</p>
<p>
Mabel also now advanced and extended her hand,
and the President bent over it.
</p>
<p>
“Good luck to you, Mr. President,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I thank you, too, young lady,” said the President
simply. “Now heed my injunction and betake yourselves
to a place of safety. We shall advance at
once.”
</p>
<p>
Once more he bowed low to them, swung sharply
about on his heel and was gone. With hoarse commands
from the officers, the troops faced to the
left and marched off.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess we had better be moving, Shirley,” said
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Instead of turning to the right, they went straight
back.
</p>
<p>
“It should be safer here,” said Mabel as they hurried
along. “The revolutionists are liable to advance
on the right as well as on the left!”
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could get some place where we could
see,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Mabel stooped in her tracks and gazed at her
friend in the utmost astonishment.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley!” she exclaimed. “Surely you don’t
mean that?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I mean it. If we could only find some
place where it is safe.”
</p>
<p>
Unconsciously the girls had borne off to the left,
and now suddenly they came upon a clearing in the
midst of the woods. And as they glanced back, they
saw the Nicaraguan government troops advancing
across it.
</p>
<p>
But even as they looked the troops came to a
halt, and most of them fell to their knees. Shirley
looked around quickly. Directly behind her was a
large tree.
</p>
<p>
“If we haven’t forgotten our tomboy days we’ll
climb up there and watch the battle,” she declared.
</p>
<p>
She led the way, and in spite of her misgivings,
Mabel followed.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI.—THE GIRLS SEE A BATTLE.</h2>
<p>
As Shirley and Mabel, from their shelter among
the branches, peered across the plain, they saw puffs
of smoke issue from the now kneeling body of men.
Sharp reports came to their ears. The only man
still standing erect, as they could see plainly, was
President Garcia, who, with upraised sword, was
directing the movement of his men.
</p>
<p>
A man dropped his rifle and fell to the ground,
and Mabel shrieked.
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” she exclaimed a moment later.
“This is terrible, Shirley!”
</p>
<p>
Shirley’s lips were compressed, and for a moment
she turned her eyes away.
</p>
<p>
The firing became louder now, and for the first
time the girls noticed that President Garcia and
his men were retreating toward them.
</p>
<p>
“We had better get down out of here!” exclaimed
Mabel. “We may be struck.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley agreed, and they were about to descend,
when, from behind them, came rapid footsteps, indicating
the approach of a considerable number of
men. Shirley and Mabel became silent.
</p>
<p>
A moment later a score of dark-visaged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
Nicaraguans, with rifles ready for instant use, appeared
and took up their position at the edge of the little
woods, several of them falling flat under the very
tree in which the two girls were perched.
</p>
<p>
Mabel uttered an exclamation as the first volley
was fired by these newcomers. In spite of the fact
that she was prepared for it, the sharp reports of
the weapons had wrung a cry of surprise from
her. Shirley, more calm, uttered no sound.
</p>
<p>
The girls could now see that the men beneath
them were a part of President Garcia’s force, for
they were shooting over the heads of their companions,
apparently in an effort to cover the retreat
of the main body.
</p>
<p>
The latter now retreated more rapidly and at
length joined forces with the men beneath the trees.
Shirley and Mabel could hear their conversation
plainly, but as it was carried on in Spanish, they
could not make out the trend of it.
</p>
<p>
For perhaps fifteen minutes President Garcia’s
men held their position, firing at the enemy from
the shelter of the trees.
</p>
<p>
The plight of the two girls was much more
serious than either realized, for a chance bullet was
likely to hit one of them at any moment. And yet
they felt safer in the tree than they would have
felt among the soldiers on the ground.
</p>
<p>
So far the enemy had contented themselves with
lying flat on the ground some distance away and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
firing at the trees, but now, as Shirley perceived by
peering across the plain, they were preparing for a
charge.
</p>
<p>
A moment later there was a wild yell, and they
came forward on the run. They spread out as they
came on, and here and there a man fell over, struck
down by a rifle bullet.
</p>
<p>
In spite of their great danger both girls became
lost in wonder at the sight, and stared ahead with
straining eyes. Shirley was brought to herself by
the sound of something buzzing past her head. She
knew in a moment what is was.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel!” she cried. “Climb as high as you can
or we shall be shot!”
</p>
<p>
She scrambled higher up among the branches, and
Mabel followed suit.
</p>
<p>
Here no bullets flew past them, and looking down
they saw that President Garcia was ordering his
men to retreat.
</p>
<p>
The government troops disappeared further back
in the woods, and now the danger came from their
bullets rather than from those of the enemy. The
girls were in a ticklish situation and they were fully
alive to their peril.
</p>
<p>
The enemy pushed further into the woods, pursuing
the government troops. The bullets flew less
thick, the sound of firing became fainter and fainter,
and then died away in the distance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley roused herself from the trance in which
she seemed to have fallen.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Mabel,” she said. “Let’s get down and
get back to the ship before some of them come
back.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel was nothing loath, and quickly the girls
slid to the ground and advanced to the edge of the
clearing. Here they stopped for a moment, looking
about them.
</p>
<p>
Several figures were sprawled about on the
ground. The girls shuddered.
</p>
<p>
“It is terrible,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t look at them,” urged Mabel. “Let’s run.”
</p>
<p>
But as they were about to take to their heels, they
were startled by the sound of a voice directly behind
them.
</p>
<p>
“Ha!” it said.
</p>
<p>
The girls wheeled in their tracks to confront a
man with rifle levelled directly at them. A cry of
fear was rung from Mabel’s lips, but Shirley said
nothing.
</p>
<p>
The man advanced and the girls shrank back. A
torrent of words poured from the man’s lips, but
it was absolutely unintelligible to either of the girls.
</p>
<p>
Shirley made a gesture, indicating that they did
not understand, and the man said:
</p>
<p>
“Americanos?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Shirley. “Do you speak English?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“Si!” replied the man, “a leetle!”
</p>
<p>
“We want to go away,” said Shirley eagerly.
“We belong on the ship in the harbor.”
</p>
<p>
“No! Stay here. General Orizaba will return
soon,” said the man in broken English.
</p>
<p>
Shirley started to protest, but the man made a
threatening gesture with his rifle.
</p>
<p>
The two girls looked at each other in dismay.
</p>
<p>
“Out of the frying pan into the fire, Mabel,” declared
Shirley. “I guess we shall have to stay.”
</p>
<p>
There was apparently no help for it. They sat
down upon the grass to await the arrival of General
Orizaba, who, they rightly guessed, was the
commander of the revolutionary forces.
</p>
<p>
Their captor stood vigilant guard. Apparently
he was determined to allow them no chance to escape.
He sat some distance away, with his rifle
across his knees. The two girls settled themselves
with their backs to a large tree, and made themselves
as comfortable as they could under the circumstances.
</p>
<p>
There was a snapping of a twig behind them, and
Shirley glanced about uneasily.
</p>
<p>
“S-s-h-h,” came a low voice. “Keep still and
show no surprise.”
</p>
<p>
Both girls recognized the voice in an instant.
</p>
<p>
They maintained their composure well, and spoke
only to each other.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Dick!” whispered Shirley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” replied Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Then we are safe.”
</p>
<p>
The girls’ guard now put an end to their conversation.
Rising he approached them and commanded:
</p>
<p>
“Silence!”
</p>
<p>
He did not hear soft footsteps passing beyond
him, nor did he turn in time to see a figure leap
from behind a tree and spring at him. The first
he realized of his danger was when a pair of strong
arms went round him, and he was hurled violently
to the ground, his rifle flying from his hands.
</p>
<p>
“Get the rifle, Shirley!” called Dick, as he and his
opponent struggled for mastery.
</p>
<p>
Shirley leaped forward, stopped, and when she
arose she held the rifle.
</p>
<p>
For a moment she considered the advisability of
advancing and lending Dick a hand, then concluded
that he was more than a match for the Nicaraguan.
Besides, the figures were locked in such close embrace
that she couldn’t have aided Dick if she
would.
</p>
<p>
Now Dick succeeded in shaking off the grip of his
opponent, and sprang to his feet. The Nicaraguan
did likewise, and sprang back.
</p>
<p>
As Dick leaped forward again, the man’s hand
went to his holster, and a revolver flashed in his
hand.
</p>
<p>
But before he could bring the weapon to bear,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
Shirley stepped quickly forward, levelled her rifle
at him, and in a clear sharp voice, cried:
</p>
<p>
“Halt!”
</p>
<p>
The man wheeled quickly and as he did so, Dick
sprang upon him from behind. A quick blow sent
the revolver hurling several feet away, and then
Dick stepped back to give free play to his boxing
skill.
</p>
<p>
The Nicaraguan rushed at him, but Dick stepped
lightly aside, and as the man went by, carried on
by the impetus of his rush, Dick struck out straight
and true from the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
The Nicaraguan crumpled up in a heap on the
ground.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel ran quickly to Dick’s side.
</p>
<p>
“Are you hurt, Dick?” asked Shirley anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“No!” was the smiling rejoinder, “but I would
have been if you had not been prompt with that
rifle. That’s all that saved me.”
</p>
<p>
“How did you find us?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Followed you. We became alarmed at your absence
and I said I thought I could find you. I
imagined you had gone for a stroll, and when I
saw this bunch of pirates going through the town
I guessed that you would fall into their hands. I
came along after them and just as I was about to go
on I saw you climbing down from the tree.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you didn’t arrive a minute too soon,” declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
Shirley. “We were badly frightened, weren’t
we Mabel?”
</p>
<p>
“I know I was,” was her chum’s reply. She
turned to Dick. “But how——”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll explain later,” interrupted Dick. “The thing
to do now is to get away from here before they
return. Come on.”
</p>
<p>
The girls started on ahead of him, and Dick
turned for a glance over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
Then he uttered an exclamation of alarm, and
shouted:
</p>
<p>
“Run!”
</p>
<p>
For in that quick glance over his shoulder he had
perceived the return of the revolutionists.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII.—MABEL BRINGS THE BLUEJACKETS.</h2>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel needed no further urging,
and took to their heels. Dick followed close behind.
</p>
<p>
In the one brief glance in which he had perceived
the return of the soldiers, Dick had been unable to
determine whether their presence had been discovered,
but he believed it wise to take a chance.
Hence his command to run.
</p>
<p>
The three sped lightly over the ground and had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
gone some distance when they heard a shout from
behind, followed by the sharp reports of several
rifles.
</p>
<p>
Dick stopped suddenly and called to the girls
to halt. They obeyed instantly.
</p>
<p>
“There is no use being shot,” said Dick quietly,
“and although they are poor shots they would be
sure to hit one of us sooner or later.”
</p>
<p>
“Then what shall we do?” cried Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“There is only one thing to do,” was the reply.
“Surrender.”
</p>
<p>
“Dick is right,” agreed Shirley. “It is foolish to
attempt to escape.”
</p>
<p>
In the meantime the band of revolutionists had
been coming toward them, and at length surrounded
the three figures. A man, who appeared to be the
leader, though he wore no uniform nor mark of
distinction, advanced and addressed Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you and what are you doing here?”
he demanded in English.
</p>
<p>
Dick explained, and the man heard him through
quietly.
</p>
<p>
“And who was it hurt Pedro back there?” and
the leader waved toward the spot where Dick had
struggled with the Nicaraguan.
</p>
<p>
“I did,” he replied quietly, and explained the
cause of the fight.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you will have to stand trial for attacking one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
of my men,” said the leader. “I am General
Orizaba.”
</p>
<p>
He signalled for his men to surround the three,
which was soon done, and they continued their
march back toward the city.
</p>
<p>
“Every step in this direction is better for us,”
said Dick to the two girls, as they marched along.
“We’ll get out of this trouble some way, be sure of
that.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know no harm will come to us as long
as you are here,” replied Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks,” said Dick dryly. “But I don’t see how
I can do much for any of us right now.”
</p>
<p>
“Something will turn up,” said Shirley positively.
</p>
<p>
“I hope it turns up soon,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
But if the prisoners hoped to be taken directly
back to town they were doomed to disappointment.
</p>
<p>
After crossing the clearing in the woods, General
Orizaba led his men to the left, where after an
hour’s march, he called a halt. Then he again approached
the prisoners.
</p>
<p>
“We shall camp here,” he said. “Here, also, you
shall be tried for attacking Pedro.”
</p>
<p>
Dick made no reply, but Shirley did
</p>
<p>
“We are Americans,” she said, “and you don’t
dare to interfere with us.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t, eh?” was the reply. “You shall see.”
</p>
<p>
Pedro, it now appeared, had been revived and
brought along. The general motioned for him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
approach. He pointed to Dick and spoke in Spanish.
It was impossible to tell what they were talking
about, but all three were keen enough to know
that it boded no good for them.
</p>
<p>
The general turned again to Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Pedro says you struck him without warning and
without provocation,” he said. “I have decided,
therefore, to dispense with the trial, and to fix your
punishment myself.”
</p>
<p>
“I warn you——” began Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Caramba!” roared the leader, becoming very
angry. “What do I care for your warnings, or for
your friends either?”
</p>
<p>
“There is an American cruiser in the harbor,”
said Dick quietly. “The commander knows where
I am, and if I am not back within two hours, he will
land a force of sailors to see why.”
</p>
<p>
General Orizaba seemed to hesitate, following
these words. Then he became even angrier than before.
He was about to speak, when a horseman
clattered up.
</p>
<p>
The general turned to him and they conversed
in low tones. Then the horseman dismounted, and
leaving his horse, made his way to where the rest
of the revolutionists sat upon the ground some distance
away.
</p>
<p>
General Orizaba again faced Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Dog of an Americano!” he thundered. “You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
shall be shot for daring to interfere with one of
my men.”
</p>
<p>
Dick only smiled.
</p>
<p>
“I guess you don’t mean that,” he replied quietly.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t, eh? You shall see.” He paused a moment.
“But you shall live until sunset.”
</p>
<p>
He turned to call one of his men; and at that
moment, Mabel, who stood closest to the riderless
horse, suddenly leaped forward and sprang upon the
animal’s back.
</p>
<p>
So sudden was her movement that for a moment
the Nicaraguans failed to realize her intention.
</p>
<p>
That moment was sufficient for Mabel to seize the
reins and turn the horse’s head toward the city.
Then she dug her heels into his flanks and away
they went.
</p>
<p>
Dick and Shirley were no less surprised than the
Nicaraguans, and both uttered cries of alarm.
</p>
<p>
General Orizaba darted forward with an ejaculation,
and called to his men.
</p>
<p>
“Shoot!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
Rifles were brought to bear, but the horse had
gained his stride and was galloping along like the
wind. Volley after volley was fired after the girl,
but thanks to the movement of the horse and the
poor marksmanship of the Nicaraguans, Mabel was
not touched.
</p>
<p>
Rapidly she rode, nor did she draw rein when
she entered the town but galloped straight to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
pier. Here still lay the small boat of the <em>Yucatan</em>,
manned by its crew. Rapidly explaining the
situation, the girl urged the sailors back to the
ship without waiting the return of the first officer,
who was some place in the town.
</p>
<p>
About the ship, Mabel found that Mr. Willing and
Colonel Ashton were ashore searching for the girls,
and so she went straight to Captain Anderson.
That worthy acted promptly. He quickly signalled
the cruiser <em>Prairie</em>, which Mabel, saw for the first
time, perceived lay close by.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Prairie</em> signalled for the captain and Mabel
to come aboard, which they did without loss of time.
In a few words Mabel explained the situation to the
commander of the cruiser.
</p>
<p>
Action came quickly.
</p>
<p>
A bugle sounded, piping the crew to quarters.
The commander detailed a landing party of one
hundred and fifty marines and sailors. These were
quickly rowed to the shore—Mabel going with them
as a guide, for she refused to be left behind.
</p>
<p>
Once ashore, the girl led the way toward where
she had left her friends, the men going forward at
the double-quick, their weapons ready for instant
use.
</p>
<p>
When General Orizaba perceived that Mabel had
made good her flight, his anger knew no bounds.
He berated his men roundly and danced about like a
madman. Then he turned to Dick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you shall not escape!” he declared.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have a squad of marines down on you in
a few minutes,” replied Dick with a cheerful smile.
“Then where will you be?”
</p>
<p>
“Bah!” said the angry general. “What are a
few marines? We can drive them back.”
</p>
<p>
“Think so, do you?” asked Dick. “I’m afraid
you’ll be surprised.”
</p>
<p>
“You shall see,” declared the angry leader. “You
shall live until you see your countrymen defeated.”
</p>
<p>
“Guess I shall live a long time then,” said Dick,
with a smile.
</p>
<p>
The smile angered the leader, and he stepped close
to Dick and slapped him across the face.
</p>
<p>
Dick’s anger boiled up and he promptly sent his
fist crashing into the general’s face, knocking him
down.
</p>
<p>
The young man regretted this act the next moment,
for he knew that probably he had brought
matters to a crisis.
</p>
<p>
General Orizaba sprang to his feet and with a
shout drew his revolver and covered Dick.
</p>
<p>
Shirley screamed. Then General Orizaba lowered
his revolver.
</p>
<p>
“No, I won’t do it yet,” he said. “I promised
you should see your countrymen defeated, and so
you shall. I shall kill you later.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks,” said Dick.
</p>
<p>
In spite of his apparent nonchalance, he breathed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
easier, however, for he had been at the point of
death, and none knew it better than he did.
</p>
<p>
“We are all right now,” he told Shirley in a low
voice. “The marines and sailors will soon be here,
and these fellows can’t stand up against them.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley smiled at him bravely.
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” she replied quietly.
</p>
<p>
Now the leader of the revolutionists signalled
two of his men to bind the prisoners. This was
soon done, and they were taken well to one side of
what proved to be the line of battle.
</p>
<p>
“I do this so I may be sure you will be saved
for me,” said General Orizaba with an evil smile.
“It would be nice to have you shot down by American
bullets, but I would rather do it myself.
Besides, from here, you can see us defeat the Americanos.”
</p>
<p>
“Many thanks for your kindness,” returned Dick.
“I’ll speak a word for you when you are in the
hands of the Americanos, as you call them.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” was the reply, “will never be.”
</p>
<p>
Dick shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“Have it your own way,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Came a shout from one of the men who had
been sent forward on scout duty.
</p>
<p>
“The Americanos!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
General Orizaba hurried toward him. Dick and
Shirley drew a breath of relief.
</p>
<p>
An instant later a long line of hurrying blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
figures came into view. Shirley and Dick looked
at them with pride in their eyes.
</p>
<p>
The marines and sailors advanced at the double.
</p>
<p>
“Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!”
</p>
<p>
The battle had begun!
</p>
<h2><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII.—END OF THE REVOLT.</h2>
<p>
The Nicaraguans met the first charge of the
bluejackets bravely enough, but they were now opposed
to men who knew not the meaning of the
word defeat, nor what it meant to retreat. Under
the first fire from the Americans they wavered;
at the next they began to fall back and at the third
they turned and fled.
</p>
<p>
Dick and Shirley, bound as they were, nevertheless
could see how the fighting progressed, while
thanks to the thoughtfulness of the revolutionary
leader they were out of danger themselves.
</p>
<p>
But now that the day was going against the
enemy, Dick feared that General Orizaba, mindful
of his threat, would return to his prisoners before
seeking safety in flight. Therefore he began to
devise a way of escape.
</p>
<p>
After some effort he succeeded in getting out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
his pocket knife. Then, holding it in one of his
bound hands, he bent his head and opened the big
blade with his teeth. Fortunately the rope with
which he was bound was not thick, and the knife
was sharp.
</p>
<p>
For perhaps ten minutes, holding the knife in
his mouth by the handle, Dick sawed at the bonds
on his hands. At last the rope parted. Quickly
he untied his feet, and then unbound Shirley, who
also arose to her feet.
</p>
<p>
The Nicaraguan forces were now in full retreat,
and as Dick would have led Shirley forward
toward the town, a single figure burst into sight.
As the man came closer Shirley and Dick could see
anger and hate written large on his features. They
recognized him upon the instant.
</p>
<p>
“Orizaba!” exclaimed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“And come to fulfill his promise, I guess,” agreed
Dick quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Run!” cried Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the use?” asked Dick. “He has a gun.”
</p>
<p>
It was true. In the hands of the defeated revolutionary
leader was a revolver of heavy caliber, and
he flourished it as he came toward them.
</p>
<p>
Dick turned to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“You get back out of sight!” he commanded.
“I can handle this fellow!”
</p>
<p>
Shirley protested.
</p>
<p>
“But—but,——” she began.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
“Quick!” exclaimed Dick. “He is very angry
and for that reason will be easier to handle. I
don’t believe he could hit a barn door now.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley followed Dick’s command and withdrew
a short distance, although she was still in plain sight
of the infuriated Nicaraguan.
</p>
<p>
Standing quietly, with his hands on his hips, Dick
awaited the attack of the Nicaraguan. A full hundred
yards away, but still running, the latter opened
fire with his revolver.
</p>
<p>
“Good!” thought Dick to himself. “He can’t
hit me that way, and his shells will soon be gone.”
</p>
<p>
Five times Orizaba fired, and each time the bullet
went wild.
</p>
<p>
Shirley, from her place of safety, watched the encounter
breathlessly. She stood with clenched fists
and awaited the outcome of each shot anxiously.
</p>
<p>
A sixth time Orizaba’s revolver spoke.
</p>
<p>
Dick staggered, and Shirley gave utterance to a
scream, while a laugh of derision came from the
Nicaraguan.
</p>
<p>
But the latter’s mirth was destined to be short-lived.
Dick, still with a smile on his face in spite
of the dull pain in his left arm where Orizaba’s
last bullet had struck, stepped forward to meet his
enemy in his mad rush.
</p>
<p>
They came together with a shock and tumbled
to the ground, where Orizaba clawed desperately at
Dick’s face and eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“So that’s your game, eh?” muttered Dick to
himself.
</p>
<p>
He protected his face with his injured arm, while
with the uninjured one he rained a shower of blows
upon the Nicaraguan’s face. The latter soon tired
of this and sprang to his feet. Dick also arose.
</p>
<p>
There was a cry of alarm from Shirley as Orizaba
stepped back. His hand went to his belt, and a
knife flashed in the air. But Dick, quick as a cat,
gave him no time to use it.
</p>
<p>
He realized his danger in an instant and acted
promptly. With a shout he sprang forward, and
seized the upraised arm with his right hand. He
twisted it fiercely, and the Nicaraguan gave a cry of
pain as he released his hold on the knife and stepped
back.
</p>
<p>
As he did so, Dick drove his right fist into his
face, and General Orizaba tumbled to the ground,
where he lay still.
</p>
<p>
At the same moment there was a cheer from
close at hand and, turning, Dick saw a dozen marines
who had gathered about to watch the contest.
Shirley came forward anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Are you hurt Dick?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Not much, I guess,” was the reply. “He winged
me with the last shot, but I am sure it is nothing
serious.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s all right,” shouted one of the marines,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
as they gathered about him and congratulated him
upon his fight.
</p>
<p>
Shirley turned on them angrily.
</p>
<p>
“And you stood off and left him to be killed,”
she exclaimed. “You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we know he could handle that fellow,”
was the response, but the men looked at one another
somewhat sheepishly.
</p>
<p>
Their reason for not interfering was perfectly
apparent. They had enjoyed the spectacle of Dick
and Orizaba locked in combat, and had felt morally
certain Dick would come out on top.
</p>
<p>
“Just the same, he might have been badly hurt!”
said Shirley, by no means convinced.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they did all right,” said Dick with a laugh.
“Come Shirley, let’s get back to the ship and I’ll
have the surgeon look at this arm.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you hurt, Jack?” asked one of the men
stepping forward.
</p>
<p>
“Bullet in the arm,” was Dick’s reply; and he
added: “But my name is not Jack.”
</p>
<p>
“Everybody is Jack to us,” was the answer.
“But had we known you were wounded we would
have taken that fellow off your hands. Come on,
there is Dr. Thomas over there.”
</p>
<p>
Dick and Shirley followed the marines to where
the surgeon was engaged in bandaging the wounds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
of an American sailor, the only man who had been
touched by one of the enemy’s bullets.
</p>
<p>
He bound Dick’s arm up quickly, remarking that
it would be as good as new in a day or two.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley!”
</p>
<p>
It was Mabel’s voice, and turning, Shirley saw
her chum rushing toward her. She ran to meet
her and the greeting was affectionate.
</p>
<p>
“How dared you take such a chance, Mabel?”
demanded Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Well, somebody had to do it, and I was closest
the horse,” was the reply. “I knew they couldn’t
hit me.”
</p>
<p>
“Nevertheless, it was a desperate risk,” said
Dick, who came up at that moment. “I expected
to see your horse go tumbling.”
</p>
<p>
“But how did you get aid so quickly?” demanded
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Mabel explained.
</p>
<p>
“And they made me go back when the fighting
began,” she continued. “I wanted to hunt you up
immediately, but the lieutenant wouldn’t let me.”
</p>
<p>
“I should say not,” declared Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley was in danger. Why shouldn’t I have
been there?” demanded Mabel. “I saw Dick and
the general fighting and I came forward as fast as
I could,” the girl continued, “and when I saw the
Nicaraguan go down I knew our troubles were
over.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
“And where is Dad?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t see him,” replied Mabel. “I suppose
they are looking for us in some other part of the
town. I’ll bet they are badly frightened.”
</p>
<p>
“I fear so too,” replied Shirley. “I guess we
had better get back as soon as we can. But we
shall have to thank the lieutenant first.”
</p>
<p>
That officer declared that he wanted no thanks.
</p>
<p>
“We are glad to have been able to take a shot at
those fellows,” he said. “We have been wanting
to do it for a long time, but this is the first opportunity
we have had. We—Hello!”
</p>
<p>
He broke off suddenly. Riding rapidly toward
them was a large body of men, and above them
floated a white flag. They dismounted some distance
away, and one approached.
</p>
<p>
The girls recognized this man immediately. He
was President Garcia.
</p>
<p>
He rode up to the lieutenant, and introduced himself.
</p>
<p>
“And I would like the person of Orizaba delivered
to me,” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
“You shall have him,” replied the lieutenant. “It
will save us trouble.”
</p>
<p>
The unfortunate revolutionist, fully recovered
now, was turned over to the President of Nicaragua
and marched away. Then President Garcia appeared
to perceive Shirley and Mabel for the first
time. He raised his hat to them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am pleased that the senoritas have escaped
safely,” he said quietly, and making a low bow to
them, he turned his horse about, and a moment
later was gone.
</p>
<p>
The lieutenant in command of the marines now
ordered his men back to their ship, and the girls
accompanied them on their return march through
the town. Dark looks were cast at them from all
sides, but none ventured a word.
</p>
<p>
“You may see they don’t love us very much in
these parts,” said the lieutenant with a smile.
“They would welcome a chance to shoot us all.”
</p>
<p>
At the pier the two girls saw their fathers approaching
rapidly, and they ran forward to meet
them. The meeting was affectionate, for both Mr.
Willing and Colonel Ashton had been greatly
alarmed at their long absence.
</p>
<p>
“I am going to keep my eye on you in the future,”
declared Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
The girls only laughed. Both men were profuse
in their praise of Dick’s gallant actions, and Colonel
Ashton declared:
</p>
<p>
“It’s a good thing we brought him along, Willing.”
</p>
<p>
The marines gave the Willing party a rousing
cheer as they stepped into the <em>Yucatan’s</em> small boat
and were rowed back to the vessel.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad to see you back,” declared Captain Anderson.
“We’re late now. We shall leave here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
at once.” He turned to the first officer. “You may
get under way immediately, sir!”
</p>
<p>
And as the <em>Yucatan</em> steamed from the harbor,
the passengers gathered about the two girls, demanding
an account of their experiences.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX.—A GUATEMALA ADVENTURE.</h2>
<p>
“This,” said Captain Anderson, waving his hand,
as the steamer entered a little harbor, “is Champerico,
the only Guatemalan port at which we shall
touch. It is the last Central American republic we
shall see. Would you care to go ashore?”
</p>
<p>
“I would like to go,” said Shirley, with a sidelong
look at her father.
</p>
<p>
“You won’t go unless I do,” was Mr. Willing’s
ultimatum. “You have been in trouble enough.
I’m going to keep you in sight.” He turned to
Colonel Ashton. “Would you care to go ashore,
Ashton?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Good. Then we shall all go,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“You can go with me,” said Captain Anderson.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
“I am going to pay my respects to the American
consul.”
</p>
<p>
An hour later a small boat put off from the ship
and headed shoreward. In it, besides Captain Anderson
and the crew, were Mr. Willing, Colonel
Ashton, Dick, Shirley and Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll keep out of trouble this time,” commented
Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
They accompanied Captain Anderson to the
United States consulate, where they were introduced
to the consul. An hour later they all started
back toward the boat.
</p>
<p>
As they walked down one of the dirty streets
Captain Anderson espied a figure slinking along.
</p>
<p>
“Hey!” he cried. “There goes that scoundrel
Von Blusen, who broke his parole and ran away
at Corinto. I’ll get him!”
</p>
<p>
He darted hurriedly across the street, and laid a
hand on the young man’s shoulder. The latter
looked up in surprise, and then perceiving Captain
Anderson, jerked suddenly free and took to his
heels, running directly toward the Willing party.
</p>
<p>
“Head him off!” cried Captain Anderson, and
Dick and the two men leaped to obey.
</p>
<p>
Straight at them rushed the young German officer,
and a few feet away hurled himself forward
with a powerful spring. He struck the three
squarely, and all went to the ground in a tangled
heap.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
Von Blusen was the first to regain his feet. He
raised a hand as though to strike one of his fallen
adversaries, but the approach of Captain Anderson
at that moment caused him to turn and flee
quickly.
</p>
<p>
The captain made after him at top speed, calling
upon him to halt. Around the block they ran,
and then, unconsciously doubling back, Von Blusen
once more found himself bearing down on Dick and
Mr. Willing and Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
A moment later Captain Anderson, panting, hove
in sight and gasped out:
</p>
<p>
“Stop him!”
</p>
<p>
This time the three spread out, so they would
have a better chance of halting the fugitive. The
latter ran straight at Mr. Willing and the force
of the contact sent both to the ground. As Von
Blusen arose Colonel Ashton leaped for him.
</p>
<p>
But the German was too quick for the colonel,
and missing his grasp, the latter sprawled on the
street. Von Blusen turned just in time to meet
Dick with a hard blow to the face, and Dick toppled
over.
</p>
<p>
Then Von Blusen darted up a little alleyway.
</p>
<p>
Unmindful of his intention to keep a close eye
on the girls, Mr. Willing, now red with anger,
made after him, as did the colonel, Captain Anderson
and Dick.
</p>
<p>
The girls found themselves alone in the street.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
The noise of the chase had attracted many spectators,
among them several members of the native
police.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Captain Von Blusen emerged from the
alleyway on the dead run, his pursuers close on his
trail.
</p>
<p>
Perceiving one man thus followed by many, the
native officers decided to interfere. Von Blusen
darted past them, evading their outstretched arms
by dodging neatly; but the others were not so fortunate.
</p>
<p>
Pursuers and native police collided with a shock,
and there was a tangle of arms and legs as they
rolled in the dirty street. The officers freed themselves
first, and drawing their revolvers stood by
while the others arose.
</p>
<p>
One of them broke into a torrent of Spanish.
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson, the only member of the party
who spoke the language, halted in his tracks.
</p>
<p>
“I’m an American citizen,” he told the policeman.
“Take your hands off me,” this to one of the officers
who insisted upon holding him by the arm.
</p>
<p>
The officer chattered volubly and clung to the
arm.
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson freed his arm with a quick
wrench, and tapped the officer lightly on the shoulder
with his hand.
</p>
<p>
“Caramba!” roared the Guatemalan, and levelled
his revolver at the captain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p>
“Caramba yourself!” cried the captain, and extending
his arm suddenly, he took the pistol away
from the little officer.
</p>
<p>
The latter stamped the ground angrily and broke
into another torrent of unintelligible words.
</p>
<p>
But Captain Anderson now perceived he had acted
rashly in thus giving way to his temper. The blood
of the other native officers was aroused, and they
surrounded the Americans gesticulating vigorously.
</p>
<p>
At that moment Captain Von Blusen, who had
been hovering just around the corner, reappeared,
and approaching the officers, addressed them in
Spanish.
</p>
<p>
“These men tried to rob me,” he declared. “I
want them arrested!”
</p>
<p>
“Si señor! It shall be done!” replied one of the
officers.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go with you to make the charge,” continued
the young German.
</p>
<p>
“Si señor!” said the native officer.
</p>
<p>
Turning, he motioned for the four to precede
him. Captain Anderson was inclined to hang back,
as were the others, but a word from Captain Von
Blusen decided them to go on.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll shoot if you don’t go,” declared Von
Blusen with a smile.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel, who had been standing nearby
while all this was going on, now made as though
to approach, but Mr. Willing waved them back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
“Go back to the consulate and tell the consul
what has happened,” he called to her.
</p>
<p>
The girls turned to go, but Von Blusen, realizing
what was going on, called to the officers to stop
them.
</p>
<p>
“Run!” cried Captain Anderson, who was the
only one who understood the import of the German’s
words.
</p>
<p>
“Halt!” cried one of the Guatemalans, as the
girls broke into a run.
</p>
<p>
But the girls did not understand him, and if they
had, their actions would have been the same.
</p>
<p>
They set out for the consulate at top speed and
they did not stop, in spite of pursuit and cries of
“Halt!” until they dashed in the door.
</p>
<p>
The consul greeted them with an exclamation of
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
Shirley explained.
</p>
<p>
“And hurry,” she added tearfully, “they will lock
them up in a dirty old jail.”
</p>
<p>
The consul was forced to smile.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, I guess it won’t hurt them any,” he
replied.
</p>
<p>
The girls looked at him in astonishment, and
Shirley opened her mouth to speak. The consul
silenced her with a gesture.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get them out, all right,” he assured them.
</p>
<p>
He looked at his watch and continued.
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>
“It is now ten o’clock. I think I can safely promise
to have them back aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> by five
o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“Five o’clock!” repeated Shirley. “And where
will they be all that time?”
</p>
<p>
“Jail,” was the brief reply.
</p>
<p>
Shirley could not repress an exclamation of dismay.
</p>
<p>
“But can’t you hurry?” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Now don’t you fret,” said the consul. “There
is certain red tape that must be gone through, and
it will take time. Besides, it is needless to hurry.
In this country no one hurries. If I seem unduly
excited it will take longer than ever.”
</p>
<p>
“Please do the best you can, then,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I shall,” replied the consul. “In the meantime,
you two girls return aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>. I’ll call
my secretary and have him escort you back.”
</p>
<p>
In response to his summons a young man appeared
and the consul instructed him to see them
back aboard their ship.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” said the young man. “Come,” to
the girls.
</p>
<p>
He accompanied them to the wharf, where he
instructed the sailors to take them aboard and then
return and await the arrival of the captain and the
others.
</p>
<p>
It was almost six o’clock when Shirley and Mabel,
gazing toward shore, perceived the little boat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
of the <em>Yucatan</em> bobbing toward them. As it drew
close they could make out the faces of their fathers,
Dick and Captain Anderson.
</p>
<p>
A short time later all appeared on deck. Their
clothing was ruffled and dirty, and it was plain to
the girls that their fathers were not in the best
of temper. Nevertheless Shirley could not repress
a slight dig at them.
</p>
<p>
First she approached Captain Anderson.
</p>
<p>
“And did you capture Captain Von Blusen?”
she asked.
</p>
<p>
“No,” grumbled the captain. “I hope I never
set eyes on him again.”
</p>
<p>
“Dad,” said Shirley, “do you remember what
you said to us about getting into trouble?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing growled some unintelligible reply.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve never been in jail yet, Dad,” continued
Shirley slyly. “Were you?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing glanced at his daughter and seemed
about to make some sharp response. Then he controlled
himself and spoke:
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we were in jail,” he growled. “We spent
the best part of the day there.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Shirley, “you are always getting in
trouble. I reckon Mabel and I will have to keep
closer watch on you.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure of it,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Dick smiled, but there was no amusement on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
faces of Mr. Willing nor Colonel Ashton. They
scowled at their daughters.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Dad,” continued Shirley, “did Captain
Von Blusen—”
</p>
<p>
“Will you be quiet?” demanded Mr. Willing.
“Haven’t we had enough trouble for one day without
all this chatter. Come, Ashton, we’ll go to our
cabin.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley, Mabel and Dick broke into a loud laugh
as the two stalked away arm in arm, looking neither
to the right nor left.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX.—UP THE MEXICAN COAST.</h2>
<p>
The passengers aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> gazed curiously
at the approaching battle cruiser.
</p>
<p>
It was the morning following the departure from
Champerico, and the <em>Yucatan</em> had been halted by a
shot fired across her bow. Officers and passengers
alike were curious as to the identity of the cruiser.
</p>
<p>
So far she had shown no colors.
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose she is English?” asked Shirley
of Dick, as they gazed over the rail at the oncoming
stranger.
</p>
<p>
“Must be either English or Japanese,” replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
Dick. “Not much chance of any other vessel being
in these waters, unless, of course, she is a
United States cruiser. But that can’t be, because
she would not have halted us.”
</p>
<p>
Signs of activity became apparent aboard the
cruiser, and the colors were run up the masthead.
For a moment they could not be distinguished, but
as the breeze caught the ensign, a gasp went up
from the passengers, with here and there a cheer.
</p>
<p>
For the colors thus displayed were the red, white
and black of Germany!
</p>
<p>
“My goodness! Will she shoot us?” exclaimed
Shirley in some dismay.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly,” declared Dick. “I don’t believe Germany
wants to go to war with the United States.”
</p>
<p>
There came a message from the German to Captain
Anderson:
</p>
<p>
“I am coming aboard!”
</p>
<p>
A few moments later a boat put off from the
cruiser, and soon scraped alongside the <em>Yucatan</em>.
An officer appeared over the side and was greeted
by Captain Anderson.
</p>
<p>
“How did you get here?” was his first question.
“I had reason to believe the <em>Yucatan</em> was now in
other waters.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” replied Captain Anderson dryly, “your
little piracy scheme didn’t work, you see.”
</p>
<p>
The German officer controlled his temper with
an effort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
“Have you a passenger by the name of Bristow
aboard?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” said the captain, “you mean Von Blusen.
We did have him aboard, in irons. I released
him on parole, and he broke it. I’ll never trust
another German.”
</p>
<p>
The German officer drew himself up angrily.
</p>
<p>
“Have a care, sir!” he exclaimed. “You seem
to forget that I can sink you on a moment’s notice.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no I don’t. But I’m sure you won’t. Already
you have troubles enough. I’ll thank you
to dispose of your business immediately and then
get off my ship.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have a look at your papers,” said the German
shortly.
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson led the way to his cabin.
</p>
<p>
As they talked, the passengers on deck noticed
smoke upon the horizon. Save for this little blur
and the German cruiser there was nothing else in
sight but water.
</p>
<p>
The blur became larger, and at last took the shape
of a vessel. As it drew nearer it could be seen that
it was a battle cruiser. It bore down toward the
German cruiser at full speed.
</p>
<p>
“I hope it’s an Englishman,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Probably is,” said her father, “although it may
be a Jap.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
Still the German officer was in the cabin with
Captain Anderson.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the head of another German officer appeared
over the rail of the <em>Yucatan</em> and dashed toward
the captain’s cabin. A moment later both
reappeared, dropped over the side and the boat made
back toward the cruiser.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Yucatan</em> was very close, and now, at a command
from Captain Anderson, she got under way.
</p>
<p>
“If that other cruiser is a Britisher, there is
bound to be a fight, and we don’t want to be in the
way,” explained the captain. “We’ll stand off at
a distance and look on.”
</p>
<p>
This plan met the approval of the passengers,
and as the <em>Yucatan</em> steamed toward a safe spot
all eyes were turned upon the second cruiser waiting
for her to show her colors.
</p>
<p>
And at last they were unfurled, and a cheer rang
the length of the ship. The British ensign fluttered
from the mast.
</p>
<p>
The German cruiser, immediately the identity of
the other was determined, turned to flee. She
seemed fully as large as the British ship, and there
were comments of surprise aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>
that she didn’t offer to accept battle.
</p>
<p>
But there was to be no escape for the German.
The British cruiser gave chase, and it was soon
apparent that she was much faster than the foe.
</p>
<p>
There was a heavy crash as her big guns opened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
fire on the stern of the enemy. The <em>Yucatan’s</em>
passengers watched eagerly for the result.
</p>
<p>
The German cruiser seemed to stagger in her
stride, and a cloud of wood and steel flew in the
air. The first shot had struck home, and in some
manner had disabled the engines of the German.
Escape being impossible, the latter turned to give
battle.
</p>
<p>
Immediately the British cruiser reduced her speed.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel stood at the rail of the <em>Yucatan</em>
with clasped hands and strained faces.
</p>
<p>
“And to think that we shall see a real sea fight!”
exclaimed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“But think of the poor sailors,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Mabel, “but they may be saved.
Perhaps the German commander will surrender.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure he won’t,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“No, he won’t surrender,” said Dick. “Whatever
else you may say of the Germans, their bravery
cannot be doubted.”
</p>
<p>
Now the first gun on the German cruiser spoke,
and a shell plowed up the water alongside the Britisher.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll have the range in a minute,” said Dick,
“and then they’ll go at it hammer and tongs.”
</p>
<p>
He was right. The next shot from the German
burst squarely over her enemy’s forward turret,
putting it out of commission.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
</p>
<p>
There was a cheer from the few German passengers
aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
But the British cruiser more than evened up the
score with her next shot.
</p>
<p>
A shell burst squarely amidships on the German.
A moment later there was a terrific explosion.
</p>
<p>
The German cruiser seemed to part in the middle.
It staggered crazily. She had been wounded unto
death, as every passenger aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> realized.
</p>
<p>
Men flung themselves into the sea, and struck out
in the direction of the <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson was a humane man, and while
the matter possibly was none of his business, he
determined to aid the unfortunate victims. He
ordered the ship’s lifeboats manned and lowered.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” cried Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Another terrific explosion drowned her voice.
The German cruiser suddenly sprang into a brilliant
sheet of flame, seemed to leap in the air, then disappeared.
</p>
<p>
The calm waters of the Pacific closed over her.
She was gone.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel held their breath in speechless
amazement. It seemed to them incredible that such
a great ship could have been sent to the bottom
in such a short time.
</p>
<p>
“The poor sailors!” exclaimed Shirley. “I hope
they will all be saved.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
“They won’t be,” declared Captain Anderson,
who had come up and now stood among the others.
“With my glass I saw the commander on the bridge
a moment before the ship went down. He has
gone with her, and so, probably, have most of his
officers.”
</p>
<p>
He lifted his cap from his head, as did the passengers.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a terrible thing, this war,” continued the
Captain. “How many went down I do not know;
but how many of those who did knew what they
were fighting for? Not many.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the little lifeboats of the <em>Yucatan</em>
were helping the crews of the British cruiser pick
up the survivors. The work went on with the utmost
haste, for there were many who could not
swim.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately most of those who had jumped just
before the explosion were saved. These were all
taken aboard the British cruiser, and a short time
later the British commander came aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel looked with some awe at this
British sea fighter. He seemed a veritable hero
in their eyes. Once on deck, he strode toward Captain
Anderson with quick steps, his carriage erect.
</p>
<p>
“I thank you for your assistance in saving many
helpless sailors,” he said to Captain Anderson.
“Without your aid many would have perished.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“How badly is your ship damaged, sir?” asked
Captain Anderson, asking the question that was uppermost
in the minds of all aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>.
</p>
<p>
“Very little, sir,” was the reply. “Two guns
shot to pieces, and five men injured. No man was
killed. There was also some slight damage to the
engine room. It was a notable victory.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed it was!” cried Shirley, who could keep
silent no longer.
</p>
<p>
The British sea captain gazed at her for a moment,
then bowed slightly.
</p>
<p>
Shirley’s face grew red at her own boldness, but
she said nothing more.
</p>
<p>
The commander of the British cruiser followed
Captain Anderson to the latter’s cabin, where he
inspected the ship’s papers. Half an hour later he
made his way over the side of the <em>Yucatan</em> and was
soon back aboard the cruiser.
</p>
<p>
Immediately he had left, the <em>Yucatan</em> got under
way and continued her journey up the Mexican
coast.
</p>
<p>
All the passengers remained on deck gazing after
the British cruiser, which had turned in the opposite
direction; and until she was lost to sight in the
distance, a faint smoke marking her location, hardly
an eye was taken from her.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Shirley,” said Mr. Willing, “what did you
think of the battle?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
“It was wonderful,” replied the girl, clasping
her hands. “I am glad the English won.”
</p>
<p>
“And so am I,” agreed her father. “How do
you think you would like to be a sailor aboard a
man-o’-war.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d love it!” declared Shirley with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
Dick looked at her peculiarly.
</p>
<p>
“I believe you would,” he said quietly at last, and,
turning on his heel, he went below.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI.—A WOMAN PLOTTER.</h2>
<p>
Aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> was a woman passenger,
who, on the trip up the Pacific, had made herself
very agreeable to the members of the Willing party.
She was not an American although she spoke English
fluently, with the slightest of accents. Neither
Shirley nor Mabel had asked her nationality, but
they had agreed that she must be a Spaniard.
</p>
<p>
The woman had given her name as Mrs. Miguel
Sebastian and this strengthened the belief of the
members of the Willing party that she was a native
of one of the Latin countries. She had come
aboard the ship for the first time at Colon, but for
several days had kept to her stateroom, so the passengers
had not seen much of her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
She was young, hardly more than twenty-five,
slender, rather light complexioned for a Spaniard,
and extremely pretty. Since leaving Champerico
she had been much in the company of Shirley and
Mabel, and both girls had taken an instinctive liking
to her.
</p>
<p>
She had travelled much, apparently, and told
them tales of many lands. Her husband, she said,
was abroad in Europe, but would join her in San
Francisco within a month. She was well posted
on current events, and seemed to have the history
of Mexico at her finger tips.
</p>
<p>
It was while the <em>Yucatan</em> was steaming into the
harbor of Acapulco, the first Mexican port at which
they were to touch, that Mrs. Sebastian related some
of the history of the revolution-torn republic.
</p>
<p>
“I have always been greatly interested in
Mexico,” she told the girls, as the three leaned over
the rail this morning. “I have spent several years
in the country. I have friends here in Acapulco,
and I shall make an effort to see them while here.
Would you care to go with me?”
</p>
<p>
“We would love to,” declared Shirley, “but I
don’t know whether Dad will consent to our going
without him.”
</p>
<p>
“We shall see,” returned Mrs. Sebastian. “I can
promise you a dinner that you will never forget.
Nowhere outside of Mexico can you get real Mexican
food, and it will be something to remember.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
Colonel Ashton, Mr. Willing and Dick now
joined the others on deck, and Shirley asked for
permission to accompany Mrs. Sebastian.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing appeared somewhat dubious, but
Mrs. Sebastian also asked him to consent.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll promise to return them to you safely,” she
said with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“In that event, I shall give my consent to their
going, madam,” returned Colonel Ashton gallantly.
</p>
<p>
“And I,” agreed Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks so much,” said Mrs. Sebastian, “and
I’ll go and ask Captain Anderson just how long we
shall remain here.”
</p>
<p>
She walked away.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Willing,” said Dick, “it may appear wrong,
but somehow or other I don’t exactly trust that
woman.”
</p>
<p>
“Pooh!” replied Mr. Willing. “What does a
youngster like you know?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I am wrong,” replied Dick, “but something
tells me she is not to be trusted. She is up
to some mischief.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Dick!” exclaimed Shirley. “Don’t you
want us to go?”
</p>
<p>
“To tell the truth I don’t,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Young man,” said Colonel Ashton, “you will
learn, as you grow older, not to jump to such rash
conclusions. Mrs. Sebastian is a gentlewoman.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
“Right you are, Ashton,” declared Mr. Willing.
“We’re old enough to know, eh?”
</p>
<p>
The two men smiled at each other and walked
away, leaving the young people together.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian returned a few moments later.
</p>
<p>
“Captain Anderson says we shall be here until
evening,” she said, “so we shall have plenty of time
for our trip ashore. He says we may go in the
first boat, so you girls had better run along to
your cabin and get ready. Mr. Stanley will entertain
me until you return.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel hurried away, and Dick and
Mrs. Sebastian stood together looking across the
water at the shore, which was drawing closer rapidly.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going when you get ashore?”
asked Dick abruptly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I am going to call upon a friend,” was
the smiling reply.
</p>
<p>
“Then you have been here before?” questioned
Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Many times.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Sebastian,” said Dick quietly, “are you a
Mexican?”
</p>
<p>
The woman started back in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Why, no,” she replied at last. “I was born in
Spain. Why do you ask?”
</p>
<p>
“I just wondered,” was Dick’s evasive answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
“By the way, I suppose it is perfectly peaceful here
now?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed,” was the reply. “I guess the fighting
is all over, now that General Villa has been
successful in Chihuahua and other northern states.”
</p>
<p>
“But there has been trouble down here?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, but it is all over. Besides, the revolutionists
probably have not enough money to buy
arms and ammunition.”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t they steal them? It wouldn’t be
the first time.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian’s face turned red.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” she asked angrily.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry I offended you,” Dick apologized.
“I spoke thoughtlessly.”
</p>
<p>
“Say no more about it,” said Mrs. Sebastian with
a laugh. “I am naturally touchy on that subject,
for I have friends who were of the revolutionary
party.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” replied Dick, and the subject was changed
as Shirley and Mabel returned to them.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later the <em>Yucatan</em> dropped anchor
a mile off shore and the small boats were lowered
for such passengers as desired to land.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian, Shirley and Mabel soon found
themselves in the first boat and making shoreward
at a good clip.
</p>
<p>
“We shall be back in plenty of time,” Mrs. Sebastian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
had called to Mr. Willing just before they
took their places in the boat.
</p>
<p>
The men nodded and waved their hands, and
the occupants of the boat returned the salute.
</p>
<p>
Now the small boat scraped the shore, and an
officer sprang out and lent a hand to the passengers.
Mrs. Sebastian was the first to go ashore, and Shirley
and Mabel followed a moment later.
</p>
<p>
The little street that ran along the water front
was crowded with natives, dirty, ragged and unkempt,
with here and there a gaily bedecked Mexican.
They did not present a very inviting aspect,
and the two girls shrank close to Mrs. Sebastian.
</p>
<p>
The latter paid no attention to the natives, but
pushed her way through the crowd with never a
glance to right or left. She continued along the
street until they came upon a long line of dilapidated
cabs.
</p>
<p>
She signalled to one of the drivers, who opened
the door. Mrs. Sebastian motioned the girls to
climb in, spoke a few quick words in Spanish to
the driver and entered the cab. A moment later
they were being driven through the dirty streets as
fast as the old horse could go.
</p>
<p>
“I thought my friend might be at the landing to
meet me,” the woman explained, “but as I didn’t
see anything of her, I thought best to drive right
to her home.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel nodded their understanding of
this, and turned to view the passing sights.
</p>
<p>
After an hour’s drive the cab pulled up before
a house somewhat larger than the rest, and the
cabman dismounted and threw open the door.
</p>
<p>
“Here we are at last,” said Mrs. Sebastian as
she alighted and motioned the girls to follow.
Then she gave the cabman a single piece of silver
and turned to the heavy door.
</p>
<p>
This she opened without the formality of a knock,
and led the way across a small patio—a courtyard—in
the center of what appeared to be the house
itself. Here they brought up against another door,
and Mrs. Sebastian knocked sharply three times.
</p>
<p>
There was a moment’s delay, then the door swung
open and a man’s face appeared.
</p>
<p>
At sight of Mrs. Sebastian the man stepped back
with a bow, and Mrs. Sebastian, followed by the
two girls, swept by him.
</p>
<p>
The door slammed behind them.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian led the way into a small but
luxuriously furnished room off the main hall, where
she turned to the man who had followed them,
and spoke a few words in Spanish. The man
bowed and departed.
</p>
<p>
“I told him to announce our arrival,” explained
Mrs. Sebastian.
</p>
<p>
The girls surveyed the interior of the handsome
apartment curiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
“I had no idea they lived so well in Mexico,”
said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Nor I,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“The upper classes live as well in Mexico as
elsewhere,” replied Mrs. Sebastian. “It is only the
poorer—or peon—class that you have heard about,
apparently.”
</p>
<p>
Footsteps sounded without and a moment later
a handsomely attired woman entered the room, followed
a moment later by a fancifully garbed man.
The woman rushed up to Mrs. Sebastian and they
greeted each other affectionately. The man also
appeared glad to see the visitor.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian then presented the girls, and it
developed that both Don Miguel and his wife—for
so they were introduced—spoke English. They
made the girls welcome, and told them to make
themselves at home.
</p>
<p>
“I have promised them a real Mexican dinner,”
explained Mrs. Sebastian with a little laugh.
</p>
<p>
“They shall have it,” replied Don Miguel, throwing
wide his arms.
</p>
<p>
“And now,” said Mrs. Sebastian, “where can we
have a talk?”
</p>
<p>
“In the next room,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Good! I am sure my young friends will excuse
me for half an hour.”
</p>
<p>
She looked inquiringly at the two girls. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
latter nodded, and the Don and two women made
their way from the room.
</p>
<p>
The moment they were gone, Shirley and Mabel
began an inspection of the room. There were two
windows, both of which looked on the street and
both of which were barred.
</p>
<p>
Shirley uttered an exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“Barred!” she said.
</p>
<p>
“That’s nothing,” laughed Mabel. “Surely you
remember all windows are barred in Mexico.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so,” agreed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
After some further inspection of the room, Mabel
crossed to the door through which they had come,
and turned the knob. Then her face paled and she
stepped back with an exclamation of alarm.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Mabel?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
For a moment Mabel did not reply. Again she
turned the knob and then she stepped back and
looked at Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“It’s locked!” she declared.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII.—CAPTAIN VON BLUSEN BOBS UP AGAIN.</h2>
<p>
“Are you sure?” asked Shirley, her face also
turning a shade whiter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
“Try it yourself,” replied Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Shirley advanced and laid hold of the knob, but
the door would not open.
</p>
<p>
The girls looked at each other in alarm.
</p>
<p>
“I never heard that they always locked the doors
in Mexico,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Nor I,” agreed Shirley. “Do you suppose it
was an accident?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to think,” replied Mabel.
</p>
<p>
There was no denying the fact that both girls
were badly frightened. They darted hither and
thither about the room, seeking a means of egress;
but there was none and they finally sat down.
</p>
<p>
“It must have been an accident,” said Shirley at
last. “Surely Mrs. Sebastian would have no reason
for wishing to keep us prisoners.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I think,” Mabel agreed. “The
door must have locked itself.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, all we can do is wait for some one to
return,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
And so they waited.
</p>
<p>
As the minutes passed, each seemingly more
slowly than the one that had gone before, the fright
of the girls increased.
</p>
<p>
An hour passed and still Mrs. Sebastian had not
returned.
</p>
<p>
Shirley was about to speak, when they heard the
sounds of footsteps outside and the doorknob
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
turned. The door opened and Mrs. Sebastian
stepped in smiling.
</p>
<p>
“I had no idea I had been gone so long,” she
exclaimed. “Why didn’t you call me? You have
been as quiet as mice.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel each drew a breath of great
relief.
</p>
<p>
“Then you didn’t lock us in purposely?” asked
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Lock you in? What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“The door was locked and we couldn’t get out.
That’s why we were so quiet,” replied Shirley,
laughing. “We thought you had locked us in.”
</p>
<p>
“The idea!” exclaimed Mrs. Sebastian. “The
door locked?” She approached and examined it.
Then she looked up with a smile. “Why, the catch
is on,” she exclaimed, smiling. “And were you
frightened?”
</p>
<p>
“No, not much,” replied Mabel slowly. “We
knew it must have been locked accidentally.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” replied the woman. “Now would
you care to wash up a bit? Dinner will be ready
in fifteen minutes.”
</p>
<p>
The girls nodded and the woman led the way.
Fifteen minutes later all were seated in the cozy
dining room, where Shirley and Mabel had their
first introduction to Mexican cooking.
</p>
<p>
Each girl sampled everything that was placed
before her, and in spite of their efforts to try and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
enjoy the meal, disappointment was written large
on their features. Mrs. Sebastian noticed this and
laughed, while the donna and her husband smiled
slightly.
</p>
<p>
“So you don’t like the Mexican dishes,” said Mrs.
Sebastian.
</p>
<p>
“Well, they are a little too hot for me,” said
Shirley, somewhat ruefully.
</p>
<p>
“Try some of these tortillas,” said the man,
“perhaps you will find them to your liking, though
they are warm.”
</p>
<p>
The girls tried some, but with no better result.
They finally gave up in despair.
</p>
<p>
The meal over, Mrs. Sebastian led the way back
to the other room, which apparently was the parlor.
Here all sat down to talk and the girls spent
a very pleasant afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Finally Shirley looked at her watch. “What
time did Captain Anderson say we would leave?”
she asked of Mrs. Sebastian.
</p>
<p>
“Soon after five o’clock,” was the reply.
“Why?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s almost four now,” replied Shirley. “Hadn’t
we better be going?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, we have plenty of time,” was the answer.
“It will not take us so long to get back.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley subsided, and the others continued the
conversation.
</p>
<p>
At half past four Shirley again mentioned the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
time. Mrs. Sebastian arose, spoke a few words to
the others in Spanish, and then came over to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I have decided,” she said, laying a hand on the
girl’s shoulder, “to remain here over night and
go on by train to-morrow. Will not you and Mabel
stay with me?”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry, but we can’t do that,” replied Shirley.
“If you will call a cab for us and direct the
driver, we shall not trouble you to take us back
to the boat.”
</p>
<p>
“But we should like to have you stay,” said the
donna.
</p>
<p>
“We would indeed be glad to do so, but father
would worry,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
The Don also added his voice, but the girls
turned a deaf ear. Both arose and put on their
hats. Then they approached to tell their hosts
good-bye.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian spoke quickly to the Don and
his wife in Spanish. Then she turned to the girls.
</p>
<p>
“Come,” she said, “remove your hats and stay.”
</p>
<p>
“It is impossible,” replied Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“We would be glad to if we could,” said Shirley,
“but we must hurry now, or we shall be too late,
and the ship will go without us.”
</p>
<p>
The girls turned toward the door.
</p>
<p>
“One moment,” said Mrs. Sebastian, raising a
hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
The girls halted in their tracks.
</p>
<p>
“We must insist upon your staying over with
us,” said the woman quietly.
</p>
<p>
“But—” began Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I said we must insist,” repeated Mrs. Sebastian.
“You may as well remove your hats.”
</p>
<p>
Both girls stared at her in utter astonishment.
Shirley was the first to grasp the significance of the
situation.
</p>
<p>
“Then it is true!” she exclaimed; “the door was
locked! We are prisoners!”
</p>
<p>
The man of the house bowed low.
</p>
<p>
“Prisoners, or guests,” he said. “It shall be as
you prefer.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley did not reply, but leaped quickly toward
the door. The others were across the room and
could not interfere. The door swung open, and
Shirley called out:
</p>
<p>
“Quick, Mabel! Run!”
</p>
<p>
Mabel sprang after her friend.
</p>
<p>
But the time taken to open the door proved
costly. Before Shirley could dart through it, Mrs.
Sebastian had her by both shoulders, while the
other woman held Mabel powerless.
</p>
<p>
Then they led the girls back into the room and
bade them sit down. Perceiving the uselessness of
resistance, the girls obeyed.
</p>
<p>
Mabel immediately broke into tears, and Shirley
threw her arms about her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t cry, dearie,” she exclaimed. “We are in
no danger. They will not dare to harm us.”
</p>
<p>
She gazed at their three captors angrily.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want with us?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“You shall know in good time,” replied Mrs. Sebastian
gruffly.
</p>
<p>
Her manner had undergone a sudden change.
She was no longer the good-natured, smiling companion
of the steamer. Her face was hard, and
she seemed to have aged ten years.
</p>
<p>
She turned to the other woman.
</p>
<p>
“Bring paper, pen and ink,” she commanded.
</p>
<p>
The latter hurried away to obey this order, and
returned a few moments later, bearing the required
articles, which she placed on a table.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian drew up several chairs and motioned
the two girls, who had been staring at them
curiously, to take the seats.
</p>
<p>
Both realized it would be useless to refuse and
did as commanded. Mrs. Sebastian passed the
paper, pen and ink to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Write as I dictate,” she ordered.
</p>
<p>
Here Shirley protested.
</p>
<p>
“What is it you wish me to write?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll hear quick enough,” was the reply.
“Write.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley replaced the pen gently on the table.
</p>
<p>
“Not until you tell me what you want me to
write, and to whom,” she replied quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
The others looked at her in surprise, then conversed
a few moments in Spanish. At last Mrs.
Sebastian said:
</p>
<p>
“The letter is to your father and to Colonel
Ashton. It will contain a demand for $20,000—$10,000
apiece—for your return.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley rose suddenly to her feet and gave a cry
of amazement.
</p>
<p>
“You mean that we are to be held for ransom?”
she exclaimed in unbelief.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly,” replied the man.
</p>
<p>
“And so you are robbers,” exclaimed Shirley
scornfully.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian’s face flushed.
</p>
<p>
“No,” she replied quietly. “But the patriotic
forces in Mexico are in need of money. We have
taken this means of getting it for them. Your
fathers are rich. They will not miss the money,
and it will mean so much to us.”
</p>
<p>
“And if we refuse to write?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“You probably will spend the remainder of your
days in Mexico. But you won’t refuse. Come
now, write as I dictate.”
</p>
<p>
“May I speak to my friend in private first?”
asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian hesitated. Then:
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but be quick.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel put their heads close together.
</p>
<p>
“Shall I write the letter, Mabel?” asked Shirley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” was the instant reply. “Then Dad will
know we are in danger and just what sort of danger.
It is the only way we can get word to the
others. I know they will find us.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you’re right,” agreed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
She returned to her place at the table, and picked
up the pen.
</p>
<p>
“Dictate and I shall write,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad to see you are so sensible,” smiled
Mrs. Sebastian.
</p>
<p>
She dictated and Shirley wrote. When she had
finished she had both girls affix their signatures,
and then address an envelope.
</p>
<p>
She clapped her hands and a young native boy
entered the room. To him Mrs. Sebastian gave
the letter and spoke in Spanish, whereupon the boy
hurried away.
</p>
<p>
Hardly had he gone when there came three sharp
knocks at the door without. The conspirators
looked at each other in alarm, and the hopes of
Shirley and Mabel rose suddenly.
</p>
<p>
But the latter were doomed to disappointment.
Mrs. Sebastian left the room, only to return a few
moments later followed by the figure of a man.
</p>
<p>
Shirley took one look at him, and gave a cry
of surprise.
</p>
<p>
The newcomer was Captain Von Blusen!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII.—THE SEARCHING PARTY.</h2>
<p>
A long blast from the whistle of the <em>Yucatan</em>
broke the stillness of late afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing, Colonel Ashton and Dick, who were
peering shoreward from the deck of the steamer
with straining eyes, looked anxiously at each other.
</p>
<p>
“What can be detaining them?” exclaimed the
former.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure I don’t know,” returned Colonel
Ashton. “They probably will be here in a few
minutes.”
</p>
<p>
A boat put off from shore; it was the last of
the <em>Yucatan’s</em> small craft, which had been awaiting
the return of late passengers. It was too far away
for the watchers to identify those aboard it.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing breathed a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
“I guess they are coming at last,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The three watched the approach of the boat eagerly.
At last it came close enough to make out the
occupants. There was not a woman aboard.
</p>
<p>
Cries of alarm issued from the lips of the three
watchers. At the same moment there came another
blast from the steamer’s siren.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
“They are not in the boat!” exclaimed Dick.
“What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing did not stop to reply. He hurried
toward the bridge where Captain Anderson stood,
ready to give the signal to up-anchor immediately
the small boat was hoisted aboard.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing, closely followed by Colonel Ashton
and Dick, rushed up to him.
</p>
<p>
“Captain!” exclaimed Mr. Willing. “My daughter
and the colonel’s daughter and Mrs. Sebastian
are still ashore. They are not in the last boat.
What is to be done?”
</p>
<p>
The captain turned the matter over in his mind.
</p>
<p>
“We should be on our way now,” he replied at
last. “I am afraid we shall have to go without
them.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing let out a roar of protest.
</p>
<p>
“No you don’t!” he cried. “You can’t go and
leave my daughter behind like that.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what would you have me do?” asked the
captain.
</p>
<p>
“Wait!” was the reply. “Wait for them!”
</p>
<p>
The captain looked at his watch.
</p>
<p>
“It’s five thirty now,” he said. “I shall wait until
six thirty.”
</p>
<p>
With this the others were forced to be content.
</p>
<p>
“If they haven’t come then, we’ll have the captain
set us ashore,” said the colonel.
</p>
<p>
The passengers from the last boat came over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
the side, and Mr. Willing questioned them eagerly.
None had seen any sign of the missing ones.
</p>
<p>
Dick, gazing over the rail, uttered a cry and
pointed across the water.
</p>
<p>
A boat was putting off from shore and coming toward
the steamer.
</p>
<p>
“I guess they are coming at last,” said Colonel
Ashton. “I’ll read Mabel a lecture when she gets
here.”
</p>
<p>
As the boat approached closer it became evident
that it had but a single occupant; and as it drew
still nearer, that the occupant was a young native.
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson hailed him through his megaphone.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want?” he shouted in Spanish.
</p>
<p>
“Message for Señor Willing!” came the reply.
</p>
<p>
Five minutes later, bowing and scraping, the boy
put a message into Mr. Willing’s hands.
</p>
<p>
The latter tore it open quickly and his eyes devoured
the words in a moment. Then he gave a
cry of rage.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” asked Colonel Ashton and
Dick in a single voice.
</p>
<p>
For reply, Mr. Willing read them the contents
of the letter—a demand for $20,000 if the girls
were ever to be seen again.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing and the others rushed again toward
the captain on the bridge. The captain read the
letter gravely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wish I could help you, sir,” he said at last.
“But it is impossible. I must get under way within
half an hour.
</p>
<p>
“Hey! Where you going?” This last to the
native boy who had suddenly leaped into the water,
climbed into his boat and was making off toward
the shore.
</p>
<p>
“Get him!” cried the captain to his first officer.
</p>
<p>
One of the <em>Yucatan’s</em> boats put off and gave
chase.
</p>
<p>
But the distance was too great to overtake the
fugitive, and it was soon apparent that he would
make his escape.
</p>
<p>
“If we had laid hold of him we might have
learned something,” said Captain Anderson. “He
knows where the girls are. But it’s too late now.”
</p>
<p>
“What can we do?” demanded Mr. Willing anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“My advice,” said the captain, “is that you stay
behind and put the matter in the hands of the
American consul. He can tell you better what to
do than I can.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did the message say to leave the money,
Willing?” asked Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing passed him the letter.
</p>
<p>
“Nine o’clock, southeast corner San Francisco
street, Tuesday. Check payable to Miguel Martinez
will do. Come alone,” read the colonel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
“H-m-m, must have lots of confidence in themselves
if they can use a check.”
</p>
<p>
“Now gentlemen,” said Captain Anderson, “the
best I can do is to set you ashore. I must get under
way immediately. I’m sorry, but I have my other
passengers to think of.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing acknowledged the justice of this.
</p>
<p>
“Give us ten minutes to get some things together
and a boat to set us ashore then,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The captain consented, and Dick and the two men
hastened to their cabins, where they gathered what
few belongings they could.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have the captain dispose of the rest in
Frisco,” said the colonel. “We’ll get them when
we get there.”
</p>
<p>
This the captain agreed to do, and ten minutes
later the three were rushing shoreward in the
steamer’s powerful gasoline launch. Immediately
they clambered out, the launch put back to the ship.
</p>
<p>
“Reckon we had better go straight to the consulate,
colonel,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Right. But how are we going to find it?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll try some of these natives. Some of ’em
must speak English.”
</p>
<p>
After two unsuccessful attempts, Mr. Willing
was successful in his quest.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later they were in the presence of
the American Consul, Mr. Edwards, to whom they
explained the matter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p>
“What are they, a band of robbers?” asked Dick.
</p>
<p>
“I should say they are probably revolutionists,”
replied the consul. “The situation here is peculiar.
All factions are at war with each other. The
latest so-called patriots are followers of Carranza,
and I happen to know are without funds. If they
can’t pay their men they will lose them. I wouldn’t
be surprised if they were the ones who had captured
your daughters.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, what are we going to do about it?” demanded
Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“To tell the truth, there isn’t much we can do.
Officially, I am powerless. The United States
hasn’t recognized the Carranza faction, and for that
reason I cannot call on its agents officially. However,
I can pay a personal call upon Señor Jorge
Hernandez. He may know something.”
</p>
<p>
“Then let’s get busy at once,” cried Dick.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t suppose you care to pay this ransom,
Mr. Willing?” asked the consul.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll pay it if I can’t get my daughter back any
other way. If she is in danger I shall pay it anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure that she is in no danger of violence,”
returned the consul. “They would not harm an
American at this crisis. All they will do is to hold
her in the hope that eventually you will pay. I
would advise against paying the ransom at once.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall follow your advice, sir,” said Mr. Willing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
“You know more about these brutes than I
do.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we shall call on Hernandez,” said the consul.
“Come.”
</p>
<p>
He called a cab, and all were soon at the home
of Señor Hernandez, who Consul Edwards explained,
was one of the foremost of the revolutionists
in western Mexico.
</p>
<p>
Señor Hernandez received them cordially, and
expressed surprise at the story Mr. Willing related.
He even called his wife into consultation.
</p>
<p>
“If our party is concerned in this matter I am
not aware of it,” he told them. “I shall make inquiries,
and if I find it is true, someone shall pay
dearly.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, some of your fellows have captured them
all right,” declared Dick angrily. “I wouldn’t be
surprised if you know all about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir!” exclaimed the Mexican, drawing himself
up.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Stanley!” exclaimed the consul. “You forget
yourself!”
</p>
<p>
Even Mr. Willing and Colonel Ashton apologized
to the Mexican for Dick’s outburst.
</p>
<p>
“Say no more about it, señors,” was the suave
reply. “Youth is always hot-headed, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t say it because I am hot-headed,” declared
Dick. “I said it because I mean it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p>
Hernandez gazed at the others with an air of
wounded dignity.
</p>
<p>
“If I am to be insulted, I shall not continue the
interview longer,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“The boy meant no harm, señor,” said the consul.
“He is just angry, that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, I shall speak more with you if he is excused,”
was the reply.
</p>
<p>
The consul looked at Dick.
</p>
<p>
“You had better go outside,” he said. “You
have already made trouble enough.”
</p>
<p>
Dick was on the point of making an angry retort,
but checked himself.
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” he said. “I shall wait for you without.”
</p>
<p>
He left the room, and went out on to the street,
where he stood gazing first this way and then that
while he waited for the appearance of the others.
</p>
<p>
A man swung sharply past him in the darkness.
Dick was caught by the other’s erect carriage,
plainly that of a military man.
</p>
<p>
“Too tall for a Mexican,” muttered Dick. “I’ll
have a look at him.”
</p>
<p>
He followed. Under a dim street light half a
block away the man paused to light a cigar. The
flare of the match lighted up his features.
</p>
<p>
“Von Blusen!” exclaimed Dick. “I’ll bet he is
mixed up in this in some way. I’ll follow him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
</p>
<p>
Taking pains to avoid being discovered, he set
out on Von Blusen’s trail.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV.—FLIGHT.</h2>
<p>
When Mrs. Sebastian entered the room where
Shirley and Mabel were held prisoners, followed
by Captain Von Blusen, she immediately addressed
her fellow conspirators.
</p>
<p>
“This,” she said, indicating the German officer,
“is Captain Von Blusen, a German naval officer.
He informs me that he is seeking, for his government,
a naval base on the Pacific. In return for
this the German government will pay handsomely.”
</p>
<p>
“In that event,” replied the Mexican, who it now
developed was none other than Miguel Martinez,
“we may do business. Take a seat, señor.”
</p>
<p>
Von Blusen did so, and for the first time his
eyes fell upon the two girls.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Ashton! Miss Willing!” he exclaimed.
“What are you doing here?”
</p>
<p>
“We are prisoners,” replied Shirley bitterly.
</p>
<p>
“Why?” demanded the captain.
</p>
<p>
“Held for ransom,” replied Shirley.
</p>
<p>
The captain smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
“A good idea,” he said turning to the others.
“An excellent manner in which to raise money, providing
you are not caught.”
</p>
<p>
“I was not aware that you were acquainted with
these young ladies,” said Mrs. Sebastian.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes indeed! I know them well,” was the
reply. “In fact I have a little score to settle with
them myself. One of our best laid plans was foiled
because of them.”
</p>
<p>
“So?” queried Martinez. “Will you explain,
captain?”
</p>
<p>
“With pleasure.”
</p>
<p>
The captain did so, and the others listened with
amazement to the story of the plot to capture the
<em>Yucatan</em>, and its ultimate outcome.
</p>
<p>
“They are smart girls,” declared Mrs. Sebastian,
“but this time I believe we have them safe.”
</p>
<p>
“I sincerely hope so,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
An hour later the girls were left alone.
</p>
<p>
“What on earth shall we do?” exclaimed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing we can do,” replied Shirley.
“We must wait for some one to rescue us.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose there is anything in what Captain
Von Blusen gave as his reason for being here?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course; but the thing that puzzles me is how
he got here so soon. You remember how we left
him?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. But he’s a very resourceful man. I wish
he were on our side.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
“So do I. If he were, we might get away.”
</p>
<p>
It was after seven o’clock when Mrs. Sebastian,
Martinez and his wife reentered the room.
</p>
<p>
“We have had no reply from your fathers as yet,”
said the former. “However, we did not really expect
one. It is to be hoped for your sakes that
they leave the money to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe they will,” replied Shirley quietly.
</p>
<p>
“So much the worse for you then.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment a native boy came in and announced
that the American consul was without, accompanied
by two strangers, and that he desired
immediate communication with Señor Hernandez.
</p>
<p>
“Well, they are on the trail,” said Martinez, with
a laugh. “I wonder what the consul would think
if he knew that Hernandez and Martinez were one
and the same person. Well, I shall see the consul.
You be very quiet in here, for you know how
sounds carry in this house.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian nodded, and Martinez, alias Hernandez,
made his way from the room.
</p>
<p>
He returned an hour later with a smile on his
face.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve thrown them off the track, all right,” he said
gleefully. “I was startled for a moment, though.
There was a little whipper-snapper with the two
Americanos—Señor Stanley is his name—and he
accused me of knowing the whereabouts of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
prisoners. I denied it, and Consul Edwards rebuked
him and sent him from the room.”
</p>
<p>
At this moment there came footsteps running
rapidly down the hall, and a moment later Captain
Von Blusen burst in excitedly.
</p>
<p>
“Quick!” he cried. “We must get away from
here.”
</p>
<p>
“Here! here!” said Hernandez calmly. “What
is the matter? Give an account of yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“I was walking along the street,” said Von Blusen,
“when I came across one of the Americans
from aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Who?” demanded Mrs. Sebastian anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Young Stanley,” cried the captain.
</p>
<p>
“Stanley?” repeated the others.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I heard someone following me, and I
waited for him to come up. When I saw who it
was I hit him with my fist and knocked him down.
He was up in a moment, though, and pitched into
me. We had quite a tussle, but I finally managed
to get away and come here to warn you.”
</p>
<p>
“And were you followed?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“The Kaiser must be proud of you,” sneered
Hernandez. “If you have botched his plans as you
have ours, he would have you shot. Come,” he
turned to the two women, “the game is up. We
shall have to fly. If the Americano has followed
this man here, my connection must soon be discovered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
Consul Edwards will suspect. We must
fly!”
</p>
<p>
“Where?” exclaimed Mrs. Sebastian.
</p>
<p>
“Mazatlan. We have just time to catch the
night train. Hurry!”
</p>
<p>
The two women turned and dashed from the
room and Hernandez turned to the girls.
</p>
<p>
“Put on your hats,” he said gruffly.
</p>
<p>
The girls obeyed without a word, for they could
see the man was very angry.
</p>
<p>
Then he turned to Captain Von Blusen.
</p>
<p>
“As for you,” he said, “you keep out of my
sight in the future. Approach me again and I
will have you shot.”
</p>
<p>
“But—” began the captain.
</p>
<p>
Hernandez produced a revolver which he levelled
at the German.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I had better do it now,” he declared.
“It will save trouble.”
</p>
<p>
His finger tightened on the trigger.
</p>
<p>
But before he could fire, Shirley sprang forward
with a cry and seized the arm that held the revolver.
</p>
<p>
Hernandez whirled on her angrily, but as he did
so, Captain Von Blusen sprang forward and struck
the man a heavy blow on the head with his fist.
Hernandez toppled over.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen turned to the girls.
</p>
<p>
“I can do you no good here,” he said hurriedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
“I’ll tell your friends where you are being taken
and we shall save you.”
</p>
<p>
He darted from the room and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel made as though to follow him,
but before they reached the door, the two women
reappeared. Mrs. Sebastian took in the situation
with a quick glance and bent over Hernandez, who
was now stirring feebly. Directly he sat up and
his gaze roved about the room.
</p>
<p>
“Where did he go?” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“Who?” asked his wife.
</p>
<p>
“The German! The man who knocked me
down.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s gone,” said Mrs. Sebastian. “Come, Hernandez,
we have no time to lose.”
</p>
<p>
Hernandez staggered to his feet, and his gaze
rested on Shirley. He took a threatening step forward.
</p>
<p>
“You—” he began.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian threw herself between them.
</p>
<p>
“There will be no harm done these girls while
I am here,” she said quietly. “Please remember
that.”
</p>
<p>
As Hernandez still seemed on the point of trying
to get at Shirley, the woman suddenly produced
a revolver, which she levelled directly at him.
</p>
<p>
“Stand back!” she cried. “Haven’t you any
sense? Don’t you know what would happen should
harm befall either of these girls?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
“She is right,” said the man’s wife. “Come, let
us go.”
</p>
<p>
Hernandez muttered to himself, but he turned
away.
</p>
<p>
In response to his call the native boy again appeared
and announced that a closed cab was at the
door.
</p>
<p>
Hernandez led the way, and Mrs. Sebastian motioned
for the girls to follow him. The two women
brought up the rear.
</p>
<p>
Outside all climbed into the cab and were soon
being driven away.
</p>
<p>
Neither girl uttered a word as the cab bumped
along the uneven street, but each was badly frightened.
For half an hour the cab continued its way
and then it came to a stop.
</p>
<p>
“Not a word!” ordered Hernandez of the two
girls, as he prepared to alight.
</p>
<p>
The girls had sense enough to obey this injunction
and went into the little station, dimly lighted,
and boarded the waiting train without so much
as speaking to each other.
</p>
<p>
As Shirley glanced back over her shoulder while
climbing up the steps, she caught sight of a familiar
figure lurking in the shadows. She could not be
certain, but she felt positive that the man was Captain
Von Blusen.
</p>
<p>
Captors and captives took seats at the rear end
of the last car, where they sat in silence until the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
train began to move. Then, for the first time, did
Hernandez breath in relief.
</p>
<p>
“Safe enough now,” he declared.
</p>
<p>
“But they may telegraph ahead and have us detained,”
said his wife.
</p>
<p>
“No one knows we have come this way save Captain
Von Blusen,” was the reply, “and it will not
be to his interests to interfere with us.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel now found themselves able
to converse without being overheard by the others.
</p>
<p>
“I saw Captain Von Blusen in the station as we
climbed aboard,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think he will help us?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, but some way I feel that he will.
He seemed sincere enough when he spoke just before
he left.”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness gracious! I hope something
turns up soon!” exclaimed Mabel. “Our Dads
must be worried to death.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if Dick is on the trail, I am sure we shall
be rescued,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“You have lots of confidence in Dick, haven’t
you?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Of course. Why shouldn’t I have?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I hope we are rescued soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Some way, I believe we shall be,” declared
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
The train sped on through the darkness.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV.—ON THE TRAIL.</h2>
<p>
It will now be necessary to go back a little ways.
</p>
<p>
When Colonel Ashton, Mr. Willing, and U. S.
Consul Edwards left the home of Hernandez, alias
Martinez, following their brief interview, they
looked about for Dick who had said he would wait
for them on the outside; but having set forth on
the trail of Captain Blusen, Dick, of course, was
not in sight.
</p>
<p>
“Guess the young man has gone back to the consulate
in a huff,” said the consul with a slight smile.
</p>
<p>
“He shouldn’t have spoken as he did,” declared
Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Is there any chance that he was right in his
conjectures?” asked Colonel Ashton slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly,” replied the consul dryly. “Hernandez
is a queer man, but he would hardly do a thing
like that.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t know,” replied the colonel. “I
have found that you never go far wrong when you
listen to what a newspaper reporter says. They
seem to smell out these things.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s on the wrong scent now,” declared Edwards.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
At the consulate they could find no trace of Dick.
</p>
<p>
“What can have happened?” demanded Mr. Willing
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’ll turn up,” declared the consul. “We’ll
wait.”
</p>
<p>
They sat down to await the return of Dick, meanwhile
talking over what was best to be done.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, Dick, on the trail of Captain Von
Blusen, was having troubles of his own. He had
approached too close behind the German, and the
latter had realized he was being followed.
</p>
<p>
Rounding a corner, the German officer stopped
abruptly. As Dick swung around the corner he
recognized him instantly and struck out with his
fist. The blow caught Dick on the side of the head
and he went down.
</p>
<p>
He was up in a moment, however, and grappled
with his opponent. In this sort of fighting the
German was no match for Dick, but he finally succeeded
in breaking the latter’s hold, and took to his
heels.
</p>
<p>
Dick ran after him.
</p>
<p>
Unconsciously the German took the direction
from which he had just come, and not stopping to
think that he might be followed, had thus betrayed
the rendezvous. He ran straight to Hernandez’
home, as we already know, and Dick recognized it.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen entered by the back door,
and there Dick stopped. He had seen enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
tell him just how the situation stood, and realizing
that he could accomplish little himself and that
haste therefore was essential, he hurried back to
the consulate.
</p>
<p>
“Where have you been?” cried Mr. Willing
jumping to his feet as Dick burst into the room.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been trailing Von Blusen, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Von Blusen!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir, and I have learned enough to warrant
my belief that Hernandez is concerned in the
disappearance of Shirley and Mabel.”
</p>
<p>
In a few words he related what had occurred.
</p>
<p>
Consul Edwards drummed upon the table with
his fingers for several minutes. Then he rose to
his feet.
</p>
<p>
“You must be right,” he said, “although it seems
impossible. Are you armed?”
</p>
<p>
The others shook their heads. The consul left
the room and returned a moment later with a revolver
for each.
</p>
<p>
“We may not need them, but it’s best to be prepared,”
he said grimly.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do?” asked Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
“We shall go back and call on Hernandez. In
my official capacity, of course, I could not do this,
but I’m willing to take a chance. We’ll search the
house from top to bottom.”
</p>
<p>
They did not enter the home of Hernandez by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
the manner in which they had gone before. Dick
led the way to the place he had seen Captain Von
Blusen enter, and tried the door.
</p>
<p>
To his surprise it opened easily, and Dick, with
weapon ready, led the way in. From first one room
to the other they went, Consul Edwards lighting the
way with a pocket searchlight.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Dick stooped and picked up something.
The consul turned the light on it. It was a small
handkerchief. Dick looked it over for a mark of
identification. In the corner he saw two initials,
“S. W.”
</p>
<p>
He passed it to Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley’s!” exclaimed the latter, after a glance
at it.
</p>
<p>
“We are on the right track,” declared the consul.
</p>
<p>
They continued the search of the house, but not
a soul could they find. From top to bottom and
back again they went, but the result, of course, was
the same.
</p>
<p>
At last they were forced to give it up.
</p>
<p>
“I have it!” exclaimed Dick suddenly. “Von
Blusen warned them and they have taken the girls
some place else.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it, of course,” said the consul. “Well
there is nothing more we can do to-night, but I’ll
promise to have the town raked with a fine-tooth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
comb the first thing in the morning. If they are
here, we shall find them before noon.”
</p>
<p>
“But where can they be to-night?” demanded
Mr. Willing anxiously.
</p>
<p>
The consul shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Quien sabe?</em> as the natives say,” he replied.
“However, you may make sure they are in no danger.”
</p>
<p>
With this the others were forced to be content,
and Edwards led the way back to the consulate.
Here he suggested cigars before all should turn in
for the night, and they sat down to talk over the situation.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have every house in town searched from
top to bottom in the morning,” said the consul.
“They must be here, so we shall of course find
them.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish there was something we could do to-night,”
declared Dick. “This inaction makes me
restless.”
</p>
<p>
“It makes me that way too, young man,” declared
Mr. Willing, “but the consul undoubtedly
knows best. We shall leave it to him.”
</p>
<p>
Consul Edwards looked at Dick inquisitively.
</p>
<p>
“What I would like to have you tell me,” he said,
“is why you suspected Hernandez in the first place?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know exactly,” replied Dick slowly.
“But he is a shifty-eyed old villain, and can’t look
at you. I have learned that a man like that is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
to be trusted. I was morally certain he was lying.
I don’t know why, but I just seemed to feel it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you figured it out and no mistake. I
wouldn’t be surprised now to learn that Hernandez
and Martinez are one and the same person.”
</p>
<p>
“They are!” came a voice from one of the open
windows.
</p>
<p>
The four within the room started suddenly to
their feet, and the consul advanced.
</p>
<p>
“Who and what are you?” he called, with his
hand resting on his revolver. “Come out and show
yourself.”
</p>
<p>
There was a sound of someone climbing in the
window, and a moment later a man stood before
them. Colonel Ashton, Mr. Willing and Dick
leaped to their feet with cries of amazement.
</p>
<p>
The newcomer was Captain Von Blusen.
</p>
<p>
Dick took a quick stride forward, and his hand
grasped the young German by the collar of his
coat.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll guarantee you won’t get away this time,” he
said grimly.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you and what do you want here?” demanded
the consul, who had never seen the officer
before.
</p>
<p>
“This,” said Dick to the consul, “is the man who
gave the warning in time to allow the girls to be
taken to some other hiding place.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is that true, sir?” demanded the consul, taking
a step forward.
</p>
<p>
Von Blusen nodded.
</p>
<p>
“It is,” he replied briefly.
</p>
<p>
“Then you shall answer to me for your part in
this outrage,” declared Mr. Willing, advancing
with great anger.
</p>
<p>
“And to me,” declared Colonel Ashton, also advancing.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen raised a hand.
</p>
<p>
“One moment, gentlemen,” he said calmly.
</p>
<p>
“Give the man a chance to speak,” said the consul.
“He shall not get away, and I’ll give you my
word he’ll do no further mischief. What have you
to say for yourself?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I can tell you where the two young ladies
have been taken.”
</p>
<p>
“You can?” exclaimed the colonel eagerly.
“Where?”
</p>
<p>
“Mazatlan!”
</p>
<p>
“Mazatlan? Where is Mazatlan?” demanded
the consul.
</p>
<p>
“As to that I cannot say. They left on the train
not half an hour ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure?”
</p>
<p>
“Positive. I followed to make certain, that I
might tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“And why are you so interested in telling us?”
asked Dick skeptically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p>
“For one reason, because Miss Willing saved my
life no longer than an hour ago,” was the calm reply.
</p>
<p>
“It is true,” he continued, seeing that the others
eyed him in amazement.
</p>
<p>
He then went into details of the scene that had
occurred following his return to Hernandez
after his fight with Dick in the street.
</p>
<p>
“But how are we going to find them in Mazatlan?”
exclaimed Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
“You might wire ahead and have them taken
from the train,” suggested Dick.
</p>
<p>
“No, I have a better plan than that,” declared
the consul.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked the others eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll kill two birds with one stone. I’ll wire
the American consular agent there to have them
shadowed when they leave the train. Then we’ll
not only be able to rescue the young ladies, but the
Mexican authorities will nab the plotters.”
</p>
<p>
“An excellent plan,” declared Colonel Ashton.
“Now how shall we get there?”
</p>
<p>
“There is not another train till morning,” said the
consul, “but,” and a twinkle came into his eyes,
“if you have the price, I can guarantee to have a
special engine and one car ready to go within the
hour, and I can promise a clear track ahead.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s have it no matter what the cost!” roared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
Mr. Willing. “I want my girl back as soon as I
can get her!”
</p>
<p>
“And so do I,” shouted Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXVI' id='chXXVI'></a>CHAPTER XXVI.—IN MAZATLAN.</h2>
<p>
It was a long tedious journey to Mazatlan, and
it was after noon of the following day when Shirley
and Mabel followed their captors from the train
upon which they had spent the night and morning.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad to get off that train, I don’t care what
happens,” said Mabel as the five made their way
through the dingy-looking station.
</p>
<p>
“I should say so,” agreed Shirley. “I’m so sleepy
I could fall right over here.”
</p>
<p>
“I managed to get a few winks during the night,”
returned Mabel. “I curled up in the seat.”
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t sleep that way. I tried, but it was no
use.”
</p>
<p>
They had now reached the street side of the station,
and here Hernandez signalled a passing cab.
Into this the girls were thrust and then the two
women and the man climbed in. Hernandez gave
an address to the driver, and the cab whirled away.
</p>
<p>
None of the occupants saw a man, who had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
loitering about the station when the train pulled in,
hail a second cab and come after them. This was
the man who had been delegated to shadow them
upon the request, by wire, of Consul Edwards at
Acapulco.
</p>
<p>
To Shirley and Mabel it seemed that they rode
through the streets of the city for hours before
the cab stopped its bumping and drew up before a
typical Mexican native house in the outskirts of the
town. Hernandez and the two women climbed out,
and the girls followed them into the house.
</p>
<p>
The man in the pursuing cab ordered his driver
to halt while still some distance away. Then he
dismissed the driver and approached the house
afoot. He saw the five figures enter the dwelling
and approached no nearer, but took a stand some
distance away, where from time to time, he looked
at his watch.
</p>
<p>
An hour passed, then two, and at length the man
turned and walked away.
</p>
<p>
Inside the house Shirley and Mabel had been
shown to a back room, the windows of which they
saw were heavily barred. Mrs. Sebastian accompanied
them.
</p>
<p>
“Now girls,” she said, “if you are quiet and make
no trouble, I am sure that you will be freed before
long.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean we won’t have to wait for ransom?”
asked Shirley eagerly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t mean that. But I am sure the
money will be paid over within a day or two.”
</p>
<p>
“And we shall have to stay here all that time?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I wish I could interest you in our cause.
You could do lots for us if you chose.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks, but I don’t care to listen to the troubles
of criminals,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
The woman’s face turned red.
</p>
<p>
“You do us an injustice,” she replied. “What
I have done has been for my country.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought you were a Spaniard,” interrupted
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I am, on my mother’s side,” was the reply.
“My father was a Mexican.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I wouldn’t be mixed up in any such business,”
declared Mabel. “I think you should be
punished for the manner in which you got us in
your power.”
</p>
<p>
“But it was for my country. Surely you can
understand that?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I can’t understand it,” declared Shirley.
“It’s robbery that you are attempting.”
</p>
<p>
The woman shrugged her shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“There is no use talking to you,” she said.
</p>
<p>
She went out of the room, locking the door behind
her.
</p>
<p>
“Well, here we are,” said Mabel, with a wry look
at her chum. “Now, what are we going to do?”
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could escape,” declared Shirley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
“I’ll tell you what. The next time we hear any one
coming, we’ll stand behind the door, and as soon
as they come in we’ll slip out and run. If we can
reach the street some one may help us.”
</p>
<p>
“There will be no harm trying,” Mabel agreed.
“They won’t hurt us, I am sure.”
</p>
<p>
It was several hours later before they had the
opportunity of putting their plan to the test.
</p>
<p>
“Quick! Here comes some one!” whispered
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
She took her stand behind the door and Mabel
joined her there. A key turned in the lock, and
the door swung slowly inward. The girls were out
of sight behind the door.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian, being unable to see them, advanced
into the room with a startled exclamation,
and looked hurriedly about. Seizing a moment
when the woman was looking the other way, Shirley,
closely followed by Mabel, dashed from her
place of concealment and out the door.
</p>
<p>
Mabel was just disappearing through the door
when Mrs. Sebastian wheeled suddenly about and
caught sight of her. The woman sprang forward
with a cry, but Mabel, in passing, had seized the
knob of the door and pulled it to after her.
</p>
<p>
It was the work of an instant to turn the key in
the lock, and Mrs. Sebastian was safe in the girls’
recent prison.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now what?” said Shirley when Mabel had come
up to her.
</p>
<p>
From the room they had just quitted a series of
blows were rained on the door, and Mrs. Sebastian’s
voice could be heard calling for help.
</p>
<p>
“No one knows she’s in there so if the disturbance
is heard they’ll think it is us,” declared Mabel.
“If we are silent and careful now, we may be able
to get out.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley advanced cautiously and peered into the
next room. Then she returned to Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“No getting out that way,” she whispered.
</p>
<p>
Mabel advanced and looked into the room beyond.
In it sat Hernandez and his wife.
</p>
<p>
Shirley nodded her head.
</p>
<p>
“No, we can’t get out there,” she agreed.
</p>
<p>
The girls looked about for some other means of
escape.
</p>
<p>
They now stood in what appeared to be a long
and narrow hall, and at Shirley’s whispered suggestion
they went back along it. Far to the rear they
could see a faint beam of light and Shirley’s heart
beat faster with renewed hope.
</p>
<p>
At last they came to a high window, through
which the light streamed. It was out of reach of
the girls, but Shirley found a chair which she
dragged forth and mounted. Her shoulders now
were on a level with the window.
</p>
<p>
The girl uttered an exclamation of satisfaction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Shirley?” asked Mabel breathlessly.
</p>
<p>
“We can get out here,” was the reply, “the window
is not barred.”
</p>
<p>
“Hurry then,” cried Mabel anxiously. “I’ll come
right after you.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley wasted no further words. She drew herself
to the sill, and looked down. Then she shuddered
slightly. It was a long drop, fully twenty
feet.
</p>
<p>
But Shirley did not hesitate, for she realized that
the jump must be taken. She lowered herself until
she clung to the window with her hands, then released
her hold and dropped.
</p>
<p>
She fell in a sprawling heap, and she felt a sharp
pain in her ankle. In spite of this, she was up in
an instant, however, and turned her eyes to the
window, where Mabel’s head had just appeared.
</p>
<p>
The latter drew herself to the window sill, and
then glanced down at the ground.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t do it, Shirley,” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Of course you can,” called her chum. “Lower
yourself as far as you can and then drop.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel maneuvered about the window trying to
get into such a position that she could lower herself.
But her fright was such that she was afraid
to loose her hold long enough to change her position.
She looked down at Shirley helplessly.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I can’t,” she declared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you must, Mabel,” replied Shirley anxiously.
“Hurry!”
</p>
<p>
Again Mabel moved about, but the result was
the same.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel! Jump!” cried Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Mabel now began to cry, as she moved about a
little on her perch.
</p>
<p>
“I—I—can’t, Sh-Shirley,” she said. “I am
afraid!”
</p>
<p>
“My goodness!” muttered Shirley to herself.
“What shall I do? I can’t climb back up there
after her.”
</p>
<p>
She considered the matter for several moments,
the while Mabel sat in the window and sobbed.
Then Shirley reached a decision, and acted immediately.
</p>
<p>
“Quick, Mabel! Here comes Hernandez!” cried
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Mabel’s hesitancy and fright vanished on the instant.
Quickly she lowered herself by her hands
and dropped to the ground. She fell in a heap,
but was unhurt and was up again in a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Where is he?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
Shirley was forced to laugh.
</p>
<p>
“I just said that to get you down,” she returned.
“If I hadn’t you would have stayed up there all
day.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel’s tension also relaxed, and the girls moved
slowly away from the house, Shirley finding that her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
ankle had stopped hurting and was not even swollen.
</p>
<p>
“Where shall we go?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“American consulate, I reckon,” replied the girl,
“if we can find it.”
</p>
<p>
“We must find it,” said Mabel firmly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes but how. Neither of us can speak Spanish.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we must find a Mexican who speaks English.
We should have no trouble doing that.”
</p>
<p>
The girls had been walking along rapidly, for
they wished to put as much space as possible between
them and their recent prison; but at the same
time they did not run for they did not wish to
attract attention by the appearance of undue haste.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly there came a cry from behind. Unconsciously
both girls stopped in their tracks and
looked back over their shoulders. But one look
was enough.
</p>
<p>
“Run!”
</p>
<p>
“Run!” cried Shirley in the same breath.
</p>
<p>
Dashing after them as fast as his stout body
would permit, was Hernandez.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel wasted no time in deciding
what was best to be done.
</p>
<p>
Keeping as close to each other as possible, they
took to their heels and dashed madly along the
street.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span><a name='chXXVII' id='chXXVII'></a>CHAPTER XXVII.—DICK IN PERIL.</h2>
<p>
The special train bearing Mr. Willing, Colonel
Ashton, Dick and Captain Von Blusen arrived in
Mazatlan only two hours after that on which Shirley
and Mabel had reached the city. The four went
at once to the American consulate.
</p>
<p>
Consul Edwards had been unable to accompany
them, but after sending the telegram requesting that
the fugitives be shadowed, he had written a note
to Consul Harrington at Mazatlan and this he had
given to Mr. Willing as a means of introduction.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing sent in the letter to the consul, and
the latter received them immediately.
</p>
<p>
“I have a man shadowing the fugitives,” said the
consul. “I told him to report here the minute he
was sure he had run his quarry to earth.”
</p>
<p>
“Is there no danger they will elude him?” asked
Dick anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Not much,” was the smiling reply. “Fisher
was formerly a newspaperman and has had considerable
experience along that line.”
</p>
<p>
And the consul was right. A short time later
Fisher appeared.
</p>
<p>
“Have you found their refuge?” was Colonel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
Ashton’s first question after the introductions had
been made.
</p>
<p>
“I followed a man, two women and two girls
to a native house in the eastern extremity of the
city,” was the reply. “I have no doubt they are
the right ones.”
</p>
<p>
“Good,” returned the consul. “Now the first
thing to do is to enlist the support of General Seauterey,
the commandant of the city. Without him
we can do practically nothing. But he will be glad
to capture Hernandez.”
</p>
<p>
The consul took his departure, announcing that
he would return as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
Dick left the room announcing that he would
take a little stroll outside. Mr. Willing enjoined
him to be back by the time the consul returned.
</p>
<p>
Dick, thinking deeply, was unconscious of the
passing of time and the distance which he had
walked. At last he roused himself from his reverie
and looked at his watch.
</p>
<p>
“Great Scott!” he exclaimed. “I have been gone
more than an hour. I had better hurry back.”
</p>
<p>
He gazed about him, and saw that he was in an
evil-looking part of the town. He swung about
on his heel and set out in the direction from which
he had come.
</p>
<p>
As he passed a narrow street, even dirtier-looking
than the rest, an arm suddenly shot out and dealt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
him a blow across the head, knocking him to the
ground.
</p>
<p>
Dick was stunned by the force of the blow, but
he was by no means deprived of his coolness nor
resourcefulness. He rolled over quickly several
times, seeking to put as much distance as possible
between himself and his unseen opponent, and then
scrambled quickly to his feet.
</p>
<p>
Two men bore down on him. Short wiry Mexicans
they were, and one held a knife in his hand.
Dick took one look at them, then turned and ran.
</p>
<p>
But the force of the blow he had just received
made it impossible for him to run far, and soon
he turned, and with his back to the wall of a
house, faced his adversaries.
</p>
<p>
Just out of striking distance the latter halted,
and spoke to him in Spanish. Dick shook his hand,
indicating that he did not understand.
</p>
<p>
“Speak English,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The men conversed together in low tones, then
one of them spoke a single English word to Dick:
</p>
<p>
“Money!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I see,” said Dick, “you want my money,
eh? Well, you won’t get it. I need it myself.”
</p>
<p>
He shook his head at the men, and they gesticulated
angrily, one of them raising his knife.
Then, with a cry, they sprang forward.
</p>
<p>
Dick was in a serious predicament and he realized
it. But he determined to do his best. As the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
men closed on him, Dick struck out. One of the
men staggered back.
</p>
<p>
At that moment there came the sound of pattering
feet down the street. The men drew back.
A second later two running figures came into sight,
and Dick cried out in amazement.
</p>
<p>
The figures were Shirley and Mabel, and even as
Dick recognized them a third form came into view,
and this Dick immediately recognized as that of
Hernandez.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley! Mabel!” called Dick.
</p>
<p>
The girls half halted in their stride, and then,
with glad cries, came toward him.
</p>
<p>
The men who had attacked Dick, seeing the approach
of another man, turned and made their way
to the next corner, where they stood to watch developments.
</p>
<p>
Hernandez, perceiving that he had but one to
contend with, and this a young man, advanced
confidently. Shirley and Mabel had now reached
Dick’s side, and the three faced the Mexican.
</p>
<p>
Without a word Hernandez’s hand went to his
pocket, but Dick was too quick for him.
</p>
<p>
“No you don’t,” he cried, and sprang forward.
</p>
<p>
His right fist shot out with stunning force, and
the Mexican rolled on the ground, his revolver,
which he had succeeded in drawing, being hurled
from his hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
Dick quickly took each girl by the arm and urged
them along.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
What he feared came to pass.
</p>
<p>
Hernandez got quickly to his feet, and perceiving
the men who had so recently attacked Dick, he
beckoned them to him.
</p>
<p>
As the men came up, he waved his arm at the
figures of the two girls and the young man.
</p>
<p>
“Catch them!” he shouted. “Reward!”
</p>
<p>
The men needed no further urging, but dashed
after the three. Dick urged the girls along as
swiftly as they could go, casting occasional glances
over his shoulder. He hoped against hope that assistance
would come from some quarter.
</p>
<p>
But not a sign of a native officer did he see.
The few people they passed looked at them curiously,
and must have realized the aspect of things
by the noise of the pursuers, but none offered to
lend a helping hand.
</p>
<p>
Several times Dick was on the point of turning
back to face the pursuers, but he determined only
to do this as a last resort to give the girls time
to get away while he held the others back.
</p>
<p>
He led the girls sharply around a corner and they
ran as fast as they could along the dirty street.
But the pursuers were gaining, as Dick perceived
by a quick glance over his shoulder. Then Dick
made his decision.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
As he rounded the next corner he whispered to
the girls:
</p>
<p>
“Run hard!”
</p>
<p>
He released their arms and stopped, just out of
sight from the pursuers.
</p>
<p>
A moment later they came into view, and Dick
was upon them in an instant, striking right and left
as swiftly as he could. Just as it seemed there was
a chance of his overcoming his two foes, a third
figure joined in the fray.
</p>
<p>
This was Hernandez himself, and he turned the
balance in the favor of Dick’s enemies.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel had gone on a few feet when
Dick had turned back, for they had not known what
he was about to do. They missed him in a moment,
however, and stopped to see what had become
of him.
</p>
<p>
They saw the struggling knot of men, and Shirley
cried:
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Dick will be hurt! What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“What can we do?” demanded Mabel. “Dick
said to run. I guess we had better run.”
</p>
<p>
“And leave him there like that? I should say
not.”
</p>
<p>
“But what can we do?” asked Mabel, in consternation.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. But I am not going to run away.”
</p>
<p>
And Shirley resolutely made her way back toward
the fighters. Mabel followed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
</p>
<p>
But aid came for Dick even as it had for his
first two enemies. And the aid was from an unexpected
source.
</p>
<p>
“Hello!” exclaimed a voice in English. “What’s
going on here?”
</p>
<p>
“Help!” cried Dick in English.
</p>
<p>
“An American, eh,” said the voice, “and three
greasers attacking him with knives. Here goes.”
</p>
<p>
Dick felt his enemies give way before him, all
but one, and this one he sent to the ground with
a hard blow to the face. Then he gazed about.
Nearby stood Shirley and Mabel, and upon the
ground were the other two Mexicans. Dick looked
at the man who had come to his rescue, and gave
a cry of astonishment.
</p>
<p>
“Captain Anderson!”
</p>
<p>
The commander of the <em>Yucatan</em> was no less surprised.
He surveyed Dick and the two girls critically.
</p>
<p>
“How in the name of all that’s wonderful did
you all get together again and how did you beat
me here?” demanded the captain.
</p>
<p>
Dick explained his arrival in a few words, and
then Shirley took up the story.
</p>
<p>
“But we had no idea of the <em>Yucatan</em> was here,”
said Dick.
</p>
<p>
“I landed not fifteen minutes ago,” replied the
captain. “Of course a train runs faster than a boat,
which is the reason you are here ahead of me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
Now I guess you had better return aboard with
me.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll go to the consulate first,” declared Dick.
“The others are probably still there.”
</p>
<p>
“Good idea,” replied the captain. “I was on my
way there now.”
</p>
<p>
He led the way, and the others followed.
</p>
<p>
But when they reached there they learned, much
to the disappointment of both girls, that neither
the consul nor any of the others were about.
</p>
<p>
“Consul Harrington and his visitors accompanied
General Seauterey and a squad of soldiers,”
a clerk explained. “They left not fifteen minutes
ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Too bad,” declared Captain Anderson. He
turned to the girls. “Will you remain here or come
aboard?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll go aboard, thanks,” replied Shirley. “I
want to get out of this city and this country. We
can leave word with the clerk here, and Mabel’s
father and mine will come aboard as soon as they
return.”
</p>
<p>
“Right you are,” agreed Captain Anderson. He
addressed the clerk. “When Mr. Willing and Colonel
Ashton return with the consul,” he said, “you
tell them to come aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> immediately.
I have important news for them.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, sir,” said the clerk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you tell him to tell Dad we had been
rescued?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Why,” replied the captain with a smile, “I was
saving that for a little surprise.”
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXVIII' id='chXXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.—ALL ABOARD AGAIN.</h2>
<p>
Mr. Willing and Colonel Ashton, to go back to
the time that Dick left them after the departure
of Consul Harrington, were greatly alarmed when
the boy failed to return immediately. Half an hour
after his departure Consul Harrington returned with
General Seauterey and half a dozen troopers.
</p>
<p>
The general announced that he was not only willing
but eager to round up Hernandez, who, he said,
was the real head of the revolution in Western
Mexico. Mr. Willing expressed his alarm over
Dick’s safety, and they waited ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have my clerk tell him to wait when he comes
in,” said the consul. “There is no use delaying
longer.”
</p>
<p>
To this Mr. Willing and Colonel Ashton agreed.
</p>
<p>
“Dick is always turning up missing,” declared the
colonel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
</p>
<p>
“But he always turns up safe again,” replied
Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’ll be back all right,” said the consul. “He
can hardly have fallen into any danger this time.”
</p>
<p>
Fisher, the man who had trailed the conspirators
to their lair, now summoned two automobiles, and
the party climbed in. The trip to the house where
the girls had been confined was made in record
time, and a short distance away a halt was called.
</p>
<p>
General Seauterey and his men now took the lead,
and surrounded the house. The general himself
approached the door and knocked on it loudly.
There was no response, but a second sharp knock
brought a voice from behind the door. It was a
woman’s voice and it said:
</p>
<p>
“What is wanted?”
</p>
<p>
“Open the door!” demanded the general.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“General Seauterey.”
</p>
<p>
There was an exclamation of dismay from within,
and the sound of retreating footsteps. Again the
general pounded on the door. There was no response
and he called to two of his men.
</p>
<p>
“Break down the door,” he instructed them.
</p>
<p>
The heavy rifle butts of the soldiers crashed
against the wood, shattering it. Several hard kicks
and it was in splinters. With drawn revolver General
Seauterey led the way.
</p>
<p>
Two soldiers, Mr. Willing, Colonel Ashton and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
Captain Von Blusen followed him. The others remained
on guard without to prevent the escape of
the fugitives.
</p>
<p>
Through the house strode the general, throwing
wide the doors of the various rooms. And at last
he brought up against another locked door. This
was burst in as had been the first, and the general
advanced first.
</p>
<p>
Came a shot from the room, and the general staggered
back, then moved forward again. At the far
side of the room were two figures, the general could
just make out in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
“Hands up!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t shoot!” came in a woman’s voice. “We
surrender!”
</p>
<p>
“Come forward then,” said the general.
</p>
<p>
Two women, who proved to be Mrs. Hernandez
and Mrs. Sebastian, advanced shrinking.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Hernandez?” demanded the general.
</p>
<p>
“He is not here,” was the reply. “We expect
him back any moment.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is he?”
</p>
<p>
“He went after the two prisoners, who escaped.”
</p>
<p>
“Your prisoners have escaped?” demanded the
general.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
The general turned to one of his men.
</p>
<p>
“Call the others within,” he ordered.
</p>
<p>
The other four troopers came into the house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
followed by the Americans and the German captain.
Mr. Willing was the first to see Mrs. Sebastian,
and he sprang toward her.
</p>
<p>
“What have you done with my daughter,
madam?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Sebastian shrank back from him.
</p>
<p>
Colonel Ashton also stepped forward and angrily
demanded that Mabel be produced at once. Then
Mrs. Sebastian spoke.
</p>
<p>
“They have escaped!” she declared.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing and Colonel Ashton were skeptical.
Mrs. Sebastian saw that they did not believe her.
</p>
<p>
“It is true,” she declared. “They locked me in
a room and jumped from a window. Hernandez
has gone after them.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll wait here for Hernandez to return,” decided
General Seauterey. “We’ll get him when he
comes back, and if he has the prisoners it will save
us further search.”
</p>
<p>
None doubted that this was the best plan, and so
all sat down to wait, General Seauterey meanwhile
keeping watch at the door himself.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he sprang to his feet.
</p>
<p>
“Here he comes—alone!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
He motioned his men to the door.
</p>
<p>
“He’ll run when he sees the broken door,” he said.
“I’ll command him to halt. If he doesn’t obey,
fire.”
</p>
<p>
It was as the general had predicted. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
Hernandez saw the broken door, he stopped in surprise.
Then he turned and would have run. General
Seauterey stepped forward and shouted:
</p>
<p>
“Halt!”
</p>
<p>
Hernandez paid no heed.
</p>
<p>
“Fire!” cried the general.
</p>
<p>
Two puffs of smoke and two sharp cracks. Hernandez
fell to the ground, but sat up in a moment
and seized his left foot in his hand, at the same
time moaning with pain.
</p>
<p>
“Good work, men!” cried the general. “Go and
bring him here!”
</p>
<p>
Two of the soldiers obeyed, and Hernandez was
soon in the house.
</p>
<p>
“Where are the two prisoners?” demanded the
general.
</p>
<p>
Hernandez looked at him and sneered.
</p>
<p>
“Find out,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“So I will,” returned the general.
</p>
<p>
He motioned to his men.
</p>
<p>
“Bind the prisoners and put them in the car outside,”
he ordered.
</p>
<p>
Then he led the way from the house.
</p>
<p>
“I shall have this man questioned more fully,”
he said to the consul, “and I shall send you a message
to the consulate within an hour. He will not
fail to tell what he knows of the prisoners.”
</p>
<p>
With this Mr. Willing and Colonel Ashton were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
forced to be content, although the anxiety of each
was growing at every minute.
</p>
<p>
The Mexicans and their prisoners climbed into
one of the automobiles, and the Americans and Captain
von Blusen into the other. They were whirled
back to the consulate.
</p>
<p>
The clerk addressed Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Captain Anderson, of the Steamship <em>Yucatan</em>,
was here a few moments ago, sir,” he said. “He
desires your presence aboard immediately. He says
he has important news for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Regarding my daughter?” asked Mr. Willing
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t say, sir,” replied the clerk.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Ashton,” cried Mr. Willing excitedly.
“Perhaps Captain Anderson has learned something.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall accompany you,” said Captain von
Blusen.
</p>
<p>
The others offered no objection and the three
hurried away together, Mr. Willing telling Consul
Harrington that they would let him know the result
of their trip.
</p>
<p>
At the water front they were fortunate enough
to find an unengaged boatman, who offered to put
them aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> for a fair price.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind the price,” said Mr. Willing.
“Hurry and get us there.”
</p>
<p>
The boatman wasted no time, and soon they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
heading for the big steamship as fast as they could
go.
</p>
<p>
Dusk was just falling as they went swiftly over
the water, and none could but think what a pretty
spectacle the great ship made with her thousands of
electric lights shining brightly.
</p>
<p>
“And that’s the ship you attempted to get away
with, Captain Von Blusen,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and would have gotten away with but for
Miss Ashton,” replied the captain. “However, I
bear no ill will. It is the fortune of war.”
</p>
<p>
“And we bear you no ill will, captain,” declared
Colonel Ashton. “It is true that you have made us
considerable trouble, but I appreciate your position
in the matter. I know that you were acting under
orders.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” replied the captain.
</p>
<p>
“I can say the same, sir,” declared Mr. Willing,
“Here, at the last, you have been of service to us,
and in view of that, things that have gone before
must be overlooked.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir.”
</p>
<p>
The little boat now scraped alongside the <em>Yucatan</em>.
Several moments later the three were aboard
the big steamship and rushing toward Captain
Anderson’s quarters.
</p>
<p>
Their arrival had been reported before they came
aboard, and so they found Captain Anderson alone.
</p>
<p>
“Glad to see you gentlemen again,” said the captain,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
shaking hands with Mr. Willing and Colonel
Ashton. He looked Captain Von Blusen over
coldly. “I shall talk to you later,” he added.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen bowed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he is all right, captain,” said Mr. Willing.
“He has been of great aid to us in searching for our
daughters.”
</p>
<p>
“So?” Captain Anderson’s stern expression relaxed
a trifle. “I am glad to hear it.”
</p>
<p>
He held out his hand, and the young German
grasped it.
</p>
<p>
“You but did your duty, as you saw it, I suppose,”
said Captain Anderson.
</p>
<p>
“What is the piece of news you have for us, Captain
Anderson?” asked Colonel Willing, who had
been waiting impatiently for the commander of the
<em>Yucatan</em> to broach the subject that had called them
aboard.
</p>
<p>
“Have chairs, gentlemen,” said the captain, ignoring
the question.
</p>
<p>
The others sat down, the older men twisting about
uneasily. At last Mr. Willing could stand it no
longer.
</p>
<p>
“Captain,” he cried, jumping to his feet, “if you
have any words of our daughters, tell us. Don’t
keep us in suspense any longer.”
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson gazed at him steadily for a few
moments, then arose, and walked to a door in his
cabin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have three prisoners here I would like you to
see,” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
With a sudden movement he threw wide the door,
and there stepped forth first Dick, then Shirley, then
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
The two men absolutely ignored Dick, who
stepped aside.
</p>
<p>
With glad cries the others rushed toward each
other. Shirley found herself clasped in her father’s
arms, and Mabel and her father also clung tight
together. Then they stepped back and looked at
each other.
</p>
<p>
“This is my little surprise,” said Captain Anderson
with a smile.
</p>
<h2><a name='chXXIX' id='chXXIX'></a>CHAPTER XXIX.—“CAPTAIN VON BLUSEN.”</h2>
<p>
“And when we found you had escaped we didn’t
know where to look for you,” said Mr. Willing,
in concluding the story of the search.
</p>
<p>
“We never doubted that we should get away
in some manner,” declared Shirley. “We were
sure you would find us, but when the chance for
escape came we took advantage of it.”
</p>
<p>
“And where did you get to when you left the
consulate?” demanded Colonel Ashton of Dick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p>
Dick explained.
</p>
<p>
“And if Captain Anderson had not arrived so opportunely,
there is no telling what might have
happened,” he declared. “He put the enemy to
rout.”
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t much of a job,” replied the captain,
waving aside Mr. Willing’s thanks. “I just touched
two of them with my fists and they went down.”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon you didn’t touch them very gently,
captain,” said Colonel Ashton, with a grim smile.
</p>
<p>
“Well, perhaps not,” answered Captain Anderson,
“but it was no time for half way measures.”
He turned to Captain Von Blusen. “And what am
I to do with you?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“I should be glad if you would take me to San
Francisco,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson turned this over in his mind.
</p>
<p>
“You have made much trouble for me,” he said
finally, “and besides, the United States authorities
may be looking for you, for all I know. However,
I have no such information, and as you seem
to have turned over a new leaf, I shall do so.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, captain.”
</p>
<p>
“I would advise you, however,” continued the
captain, “to go ashore at the first American port
instead of going to Frisco. The authorities may
be on the lookout for you, and I don’t know what
they would do with you. Your theft of the <em>Yucatan</em>
was nothing short of piracy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you are right,” returned Captain Von
Blusen, “and I shall act upon your advice. What is
the first United States port at which you shall
touch?”
</p>
<p>
“San Diego.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I shall go ashore there.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, unless, of course, in the meantime
I should receive word to hold you.”
</p>
<p>
“But you won’t report the captain’s presence
here?” exclaimed Shirley hopefully.
</p>
<p>
“No; I shall say nothing about it unless I am
asked.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you again, captain,” said the young officer.
</p>
<p>
He turned on his heel and left the room.
</p>
<p>
“When shall we get under way again, captain?”
asked Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
“First thing in the morning,” was the reply.
“We’ll probably be out of sight of land when you
tumble out.”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t get away from here any too quick
to suit me,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed,” Mabel agreed. “We have had
trouble enough to last us for a long time to come.
The sooner we get back to civilization the better.”
</p>
<p>
“And that goes for all of us,” agreed Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad to have you back aboard the <em>Yucatan</em>,”
declared Captain Anderson. “To tell the
truth, I didn’t expect to see you in Mazatlan. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
felt sure you would eventually find the young ladies
safe and sound, but I feared I should have to make
the rest of the trip without you. I tell you, it
made me feel good to run across young Stanley
here this afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
“It didn’t make you feel as good as it did me,
captain,” returned Dick significantly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, perhaps not under the circumstances,”
laughed the captain. “The only one of our passengers
who will not complete the trip is Mrs.
Sebastian.”
</p>
<p>
“And a good thing for all concerned,” declared
Colonel Ashton. “I don’t see how she fooled us
so completely, Willing.”
</p>
<p>
“She did though,” returned Mr. Willing. “I
would never have suspected her of having any
ulterior motives.”
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t listen to me,” said Dick. “I suspected
her from the first. Now I can say ‘I told
you so.’”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll place more confidence in your foresight
in the future,” declared the colonel.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to run you away,” said Captain
Anderson, “but it’s my belief you had all better
turn in. You look fagged out, the whole bunch of
you. Sleep is the best remedy.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right, captain,” declared Shirley. “I
feel as though I could go to sleep standing on my
feet.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
They bade the captain good-night, thanked him
again for his assistance, and made their way to
their cabin, where, after some further talk, all
turned in.
</p>
<p>
So completely were they exhausted that it was
after eight o’clock the following morning when
Shirley, the first to awake, sprang up. She glanced
out the window of her stateroom. The sun shone
brightly, and from the barely perceptible motion
of the steamer she knew they were moving.
</p>
<p>
She called Mabel, and the girls dressed quickly.
Shirley knocked on the next door and aroused the
others, and an hour later, after a hearty breakfast,
all stood forward on the promenade deck enjoying
the fresh morning breeze.
</p>
<p>
There was not a speck of land in sight and
would not be for hours. An hour later Captain
Von Blusen joined them and after awhile Captain
Anderson stopped to exchange a few words.
</p>
<p>
It was while the commander of the <em>Yucatan</em>
was there that there came a hail from the lookout.
</p>
<p>
“Smoke to the leeward, sir!”
</p>
<p>
All glanced in the direction indicated. There,
upon the distant horizon, was a faint cloud of
smoke. As they gazed it presently took shape, and
half an hour later it did not take the second cry of
the lookout to tell them the approaching vessel
was a battle cruiser of the first class.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wonder what this one is?” said Shirley, as the
vessel drew nearer.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. It might be German. It has
been supposed there were two German vessels in
these waters, but we have already encountered one.
This may be another.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s hardly possible, though,” said Mr. Willing.
“Captain Von Blusen, to your knowledge, are there
any German ships of war in these waters?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t answer that question definitely, sir,” he
replied. “All I can say is that it is possible.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe this is a German,” said Dick.
“But whatever she is she is coming right toward
us.”
</p>
<p>
It was true. The stranger was shaping a course
that would intercept the <em>Yucatan</em> several miles
ahead.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if she will stop us?” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” replied Captain Von Blusen. “The
commander will probably come aboard to have a
look at the ship’s papers.”
</p>
<p>
“Will he interfere with you?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly,” was the reply. “In spite of the fact
that I am a German, he will not dare to interfere
with me aboard a neutral ship.”
</p>
<p>
“Boom!”
</p>
<p>
It was the sound of a great gun aboard the
cruiser.
</p>
<p>
“Signal to heave-to,” said Captain Anderson.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
</p>
<p>
He made his way to the bridge, and in response to
his command, the <em>Yucatan</em> came to a pause.
Then all eagerly waited for the cruiser to show her
colors.
</p>
<p>
“German!” was the audible gasp from the passengers
as the red, white and black of the German
Empire were unfurled at the masthead.
</p>
<p>
“I am coming aboard you,” was the message
the German commander flashed to Captain Anderson.
</p>
<p>
A small boat put off from the cruiser and soon
bumped alongside the <em>Yucatan</em>. A moment later
an officer in a smart uniform came over the side.
He made his way at once to where Captain Anderson
stood on the bridge.
</p>
<p>
“Is this the way you meet a German naval officer?”
he demanded angrily.
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson looked at him in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“What would you have me do?” he demanded,
taking a step forward.
</p>
<p>
“And when you address me, say sir!” exclaimed
the German, who seemed rather young and possessed
of much self-importance. “You should have
met me as I came over-side.”
</p>
<p>
“Say sir to you, eh?” exclaimed Captain Anderson.
“If you don’t get off my ship in five minutes
I’ll throw you over the rail.”
</p>
<p>
The German officer stepped back, and half drew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
a revolver. Captain Anderson advanced another
step.
</p>
<p>
But interference came from an unexpected
source.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen, who had stood close enough
to overhear this conversation, suddenly ascended
to the bridge. He walked quickly up behind the
German officer, and seizing him by the shoulder,
swung him around sharply.
</p>
<p>
“You forget yourself, Lieutenant Von Meyers!”
he said angrily. “Get back to your boat!”
</p>
<p>
The German lieutenant gazed at this newcomer
threateningly, then a look of the greatest astonishment
passed over his face. He took three quick
steps backward.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen stood perfectly erect, one
hand pointing toward the small boat from which
the German lieutenant had just climbed to the deck
of the <em>Yucatan</em>. He said no further word.
</p>
<p>
And while officers and passengers of the <em>Yucatan</em>
looked on in amazement, the German lieutenant
took two quick steps forward again, fell upon
one knee, took Captain Von Blusen’s other hand
and touched it with his lips!
</p>
<p>
Then he arose, saluted, and walked rapidly away.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span><a name='chXXX' id='chXXX'></a>CHAPTER XXX.—THROUGH THE GOLDEN GATE.</h2>
<p>
There was an audible gasp from passengers and
crew, and the same question was upon every lip:
</p>
<p>
“Who is he?”
</p>
<p>
As the German lieutenant reached the side of the
ship, Captain Von Blusen spoke again:
</p>
<p>
“Lieutenant Von Meyers!”
</p>
<p>
The lieutenant turned about sharply, and came
to attention.
</p>
<p>
“You will wait with the boat. I shall go with
you.”
</p>
<p>
The lieutenant saluted again and stood stiffly
erect in his tracks.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen turned to Captain Anderson.
</p>
<p>
“I shall relieve you of the responsibility of my
presence immediately, captain,” he said quietly.
“I shall go aboard the cruiser.”
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson was too much taken by surprise
to mutter more than:
</p>
<p>
“Very well, sir.”
</p>
<p>
Why he added the “sir” the captain could not
have told, but there was something in the bearing
of the man that faced him that called it forth involuntarily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen held out his hand, and the
commander of the <em>Yucatan</em> grasped it.
</p>
<p>
“Good luck to you, sir,” said the latter.
</p>
<p>
“And to you,” returned Captain Von Blusen.
</p>
<p>
He descended from the bridge, and made his way
to where the Willing party stood gazing at him in
open-eyed wonder.
</p>
<p>
The German officer first addressed Mr. Willing
and Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry that I have been the means of putting
you to so much trouble,” he said, with a slight
bow, “but whatever I did I considered in line with
my duty. Please believe that.”
</p>
<p>
“I have no doubt of it,” replied Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Nor I,” agreed Colonel Ashton.
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen now turned to Dick, and
with the slightest of smiles he extended his hand.
</p>
<p>
“As you and I had a little difficulty,” he said,
“I pray you will overlook it.”
</p>
<p>
Dick grasped the extended hand, as he replied.
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course. I guess I am a bit hot-headed
once in a while.”
</p>
<p>
“No more than I am,” returned Captain Von
Blusen. “It has been my chief fault.”
</p>
<p>
He pressed Dick’s hand once more, and then
turned to the two girls, who had been too stunned
by what they had witnessed, to speak.
</p>
<p>
The captain extended a hand to each in turn
and Shirley and Mabel shook hands with him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am pleased to have met you, Miss Ashton,”
he said courteously, “and you, Miss Willing, and
I regret that I have been the means of causing you
unpleasantness. But as I have said to your fathers,
what I did was but in the line of duty. Now I
must say good-bye, but when the war is over,” he
looked at Mabel, “I hope that I shall see you both
again.”
</p>
<p>
He bowed low, and before the girls could reply,
he made his way toward the spot where the German
lieutenant stood awaiting him. He motioned
the latter to precede him over the side, and was
just about to follow, when he seemed to think of
something.
</p>
<p>
He walked quickly back across the deck to where
Shirley and Mabel stood, and spoke.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you all wonder who I am,” he said
quietly, “and while I would greatly like to satisfy
your curiosity, I fear it is impossible at this time.”
</p>
<p>
Now Shirley found her tongue.
</p>
<p>
“You can at least tell us whether you are of
royal birth,” she cried.
</p>
<p>
Again Captain Von Blusen bowed low.
</p>
<p>
“I cannot say yes, nor can I deny it,” he answered.
</p>
<p>
“Then your name is not really Captain Von
Blusen?”
</p>
<p>
The captain smiled and bowed, but made no reply.
</p>
<p>
Now Mabel spoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
“Captain,” she said quietly, “for by such name
only can we know you now, we should, of course,
be honored with your confidence, but if you cannot
speak at this time, I for one shall ask you no questions.”
</p>
<p>
Captain Von Blusen took her hand and bent over
it gallantly.
</p>
<p>
“I thank you, Miss Ashton,” he replied quietly.
“Some day I hope to be able to confide in you.”
</p>
<p>
He bowed to the others, and turning sharply on
his heel, made his way to the side of the ship and
clambered over the rail.
</p>
<p>
Now the passengers hurried to the side of the
ship, and gazed with something like awe at the boat
that made swiftly for the German cruiser.
</p>
<p>
Captain Anderson did not give the signal to get
under way until the cruiser’s launch was being
hoisted aboard, when there broke out from the
cruiser a salvo of guns.
</p>
<p>
“A salute!” cried Captain Anderson, raising his
voice to make himself heard. “He is some one of
importance. Now I wonder——”
</p>
<p>
He broke off suddenly, as he counted the number
of guns and, in his mind, ran over the list of relatives
of the German Emperor. Then his clouded
brow cleared, and he smiled.
</p>
<p>
“If he wishes to keep it a secret, I am not the
man to betray it,” he said to himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p>
That Captain Anderson knew who “Captain Von
Blusen” really was there could be no doubt, but the
commander of the <em>Yucatan</em> kept his promise to
himself and confided to no one, in spite of the questions
that were poured on him later.
</p>
<p>
Now Captain Anderson gave the signal to get
under way, and the <em>Yucatan</em> slowly gathered
headway. The German cruiser remained stationary
as the <em>Yucatan</em> approached, and the big steamship
passed her less than a quarter of a mile away.
</p>
<p>
There, on the bridge of the cruiser, with the
commander of the vessel and his officers standing
at attention, stood “Captain Von Blusen.” The
passengers waved their hands at him, and he, in return,
lifted his cap and made a low bow.
</p>
<p>
Then the passengers aboard the <em>Yucatan</em> saw
him turn to the man they could make out was the
commander of the cruiser and give a sharp command.
The latter repeated it to one of his officers,
and a moment later a second salvo broke out from
the cruiser. At the same time the German flag at
the masthead was dipped in salute.
</p>
<p>
“That,” said Captain Anderson calmly, “is a fine
token of respect. Too bad we haven’t the guns with
which to return it.”
</p>
<p>
He gave an order, however, and the American
ensign at the masthead of the <em>Yucatan</em> returned
the salute.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
</p>
<p>
These courtesies having been exchanged, all became
bustle and hurry aboard the German cruiser,
as the passengers on the <em>Yucatan</em> could see. Men
dashed hurriedly hither and thither, and a moment
later the cruiser swung slowly about and headed
due south.
</p>
<p>
“And that is the last we shall see of Captain Von
Blusen,” declared Shirley. “I wonder who he is.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t any idea,” returned Mabel slowly, “but
there can be no question that he is of high rank.”
</p>
<p>
“No, there can be no question about that,” agreed
Mr. Willing, who had overheard this conversation.
“I should say that he is a member of the Imperial
German family.”
</p>
<p>
“Then what is he doing in the United States?”
</p>
<p>
“I have learned a couple of Mexican words,” replied
Mr. Willing. “Quien sabe?” (Who knows.)
</p>
<p>
“But he said we should hear from him when the
war is over,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Shirley, “he said ‘we’ but he meant
you.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel’s face turned a trifle red.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” she asked in some confusion.
</p>
<p>
Shirley laughed.
</p>
<p>
“I guess you know what I mean, all right,” she
made reply. “Do you remember saying something
like that to me once?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
“But I had reason to,” protested Mabel. “It was
so plain in Dick’s case.”
</p>
<p>
“No more so than in Captain Von Blusen’s case,”
declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes you do. You mean you just won’t
admit it. Well, you don’t have to. Why, what
makes your face so red, Mabel?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” declared
Mabel, and turning about quickly, she rushed
to her cabin, leaving Shirley laughing to herself.
</p>
<p>
The steamship <em>Yucatan</em> was forging ahead at
full speed now, and was rapidly lessening the distance
to the first California port—San Diego.
</p>
<p>
“Dad,” said Shirley, “isn’t there a second fair
at San Diego?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied her father, “why?”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, why can’t we stop off there for a
day or two and go on to San Francisco by rail?”
</p>
<p>
“We can if you wish it,” replied Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Then let’s do, Dad.”
</p>
<p>
“All right.”
</p>
<p>
And so it was arranged. Shirley went below
where she and Mabel immediately began gathering
their things together so that they would be ready
to leave the boat the moment it docked at San
Diego.
</p>
<p>
There was no question that the girls had become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
great favorites with all the passengers. Many
pressed them to continue the trip to San Francisco,
Captain Anderson being one of the most anxious to
keep them aboard as long as possible.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what I shall do without you,” he
told Shirley and Mabel. “We have had lots of excitement
on this voyage, more than ever before, and
you two girls have been mainly responsible for it.
I hope that I shall see you again some time.”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” said Shirley, “there are many more summers
coming, and if we ever decide to make this
trip again we shall not ever think of taking any boat
but yours.”
</p>
<p>
“May the time come soon,” said the captain.
</p>
<p>
The passengers bade them an affectionate good-bye
as they left the <em>Yucatan</em> at San Diego, and
then they entered a taxi and were driven to a hotel,
where they once more made themselves comfortable
for a stay ashore.
</p>
<p>
They spent two days at the San Diego exposition,
and then took a train for San Francisco to view,
as Shirley expressed it, “the greatest sight they ever
expected to see.”
</p>
<p>
And none of the party was a whit disappointed
in the great exposition. In fact, it was far beyond
expectations. For two weeks they remained in
the California metropolis, spending every minute
possible upon the large exposition grounds overlooking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
the Golden Gate and the broad expanse to
the Pacific.
</p>
<p>
When the time came for them to betake themselves
homeward, it was with regret that they
realized it would be long before they could again
hope to see the beauties of the far-off state of California.
</p>
<p>
There remains yet one incident to be told.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks after their return home, Mabel received
a registered package postmarked Rome,
Italy. Eagerly she ran to her room with it, where
she opened it in solitude; nor could she repress a cry
of admiration when she drew out a beautifully bejeweled
cross, patterned after the Iron Cross of
Germany—the Iron Cross with which the German
Emperor decorates his troops for bravery.
</p>
<p>
With it there was a brief note, with the signature
“Captain Von Blusen.”
</p>
<p>
Looking closer at the piece of paper on which
the message was written, Mabel perceived a seal of
peculiar design. She ran hastily for her dictionary,
and turned to the seals of the various nations.
</p>
<p>
There was a striking similarity between the seal
on the paper and the Imperial German seal, as
reproduced, in colors, in her big dictionary.
</p>
<p>
For perhaps half an hour the girl sat silent, musing.

<span style='font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;'>The Camp Fire Girls Series</span>
</p>
<p>
By HILDEGARD G. FREY. The only series of stories
for Camp Fire Girls endorsed by the officials of the Camp
Fire Girls Organization.
</p>
<p>
PRICE, 40 CENTS PER VOLUME
</p>
<p>
THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS IN THE MAINE WOODS; or, The Winnebagos go Camping.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
This lively Camp Fire group and their Guardian go back to Nature in a
camp in the wilds of Maine, and pile up more adventures in one summer
than they have had in all their previous vacations put together. Before
the summer is over they have transformed Gladys, the frivolous boarding
school girl, into a genuine Winnebago.
</p>
<p>
THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS AT SCHOOL, or, The Wohelo Weavers.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
It is the custom of the Winnebagos to weave the events of their lives
into symbolic bead bands, instead of keeping a diary. All commendatory
doings are worked out in bright colors, but every time the Law of
the Camp Fire is broken it must be recorded in black. How these
seven live wire girls strive to infuse into their school life the spirit of
Work, Health and Love and yet manage to get into more than their
share of mischief, is told in this story.
</p>
<p>
THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS AT ONOWAY HOUSE; or, The Magic Garden.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
Migwan is determined to go to college, and not being strong enough to
work indoors earns the money by raising fruits and vegetables. The
Winnebagos all turn a hand to help the cause along and the “goings-on”
at Onoway Homes that summer make the foundations shake with
laughter.
</p>
<p>
THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS GO MOTORING; or, Along the Road that Leads the Way.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
The Winnebagos take a thousand mile auto trip. The “pinching” of
Nyoda, the fire in the country inn, the runaway girl and the dead-earnest
hare and hound chase combine to make these three weeks the
most exciting the Winnebagos have ever experienced.

</p>
<p>
Miss Blanchard has won an enviable reputation
as a writer of short stories for girls. Her books are
thoroughly wholesome in every way and her style is full
of charm. The titles described below will be splendid additions to
every girl’s library.
</p>
<p>
Handsomely bound in cloth, full library size.
Illustrated by L. J. Bridgman. Price, 60 cents per volume, postpaid.
</p>
<p>
THE GLAD LADY. A spirited account of a remarkably pleasant
vacation spent in an unfrequented part of northern Spain. This summer,
which promised at the outset to be very quiet, proved to be exactly the
opposite. Event follows event in rapid succession and the story ends with
the culmination of at least two happy romances. The story throughout is
interwoven with vivid descriptions of real places and people of which the
general public knows very little. These add greatly to the reader’s interest.
</p>
<p>
WIT’S END. Instilled with life, color and individuality, this story of
true love cannot fail to attract and hold to its happy end the reader’s eager
attention. The word pictures are masterly; while the poise of narrative and
description is marvellously preserved.
</p>
<p>
A JOURNEY OF JOY. A charming story of the travels and
adventures of two young American girls, and an elderly companion in Europe.
It is not only well told, but the amount of information contained will make it
a very valuable addition to the library of any girl who anticipates making a
similar trip. Their many pleasant experiences end in the culmination of two
happy romances, all told in the happiest vein.
</p>
<p>
TALBOT’S ANGLES. A charming romance of Southern life.
Talbot’s Angles is a beautiful old estate located on the Eastern Shore of
Maryland. The death of the owner and the ensuing legal troubles render it
necessary for our heroine, the present owner, to leave the place which has
been in her family for hundreds of years and endeavor to earn her own living.
Another claimant for the property appearing on the scene complicates matters
still more. The untangling of this mixed-up condition of affairs makes an
extremely interesting story.

In this series of remarkable stories by Wilmer M.
Ely are described the adventures of two boy chums—Charley
West and Walter Hazard—in the great swamps
of interior Florida and among the cays off the Florida
Coast, and through the Bahama Islands. These are real,
live boys, and their experiences are well worth following.

In this story Charley West and Walter Hazard meet deadly rattlesnakes: have
a battle with a wild panther; are attacked by outlaws: their boat is towed by a
swordfish; they are shipwrecked by a monster manatee fish, and pass safely
through many exciting scenes of danger. This book should be read first.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
This book tells the story of the boy chums’ adventures on the schooner “Eager

</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
The story of the boy chums hunting the blue herons and the pink and white
egrets for their plumes in the forests of Florida is full of danger and excitement.
In this story is fully told how the chums encountered the Indians; their battles
with the escaped convicts; their fight with the wild boars and alligators; and
many exciting encounters and escapes. This is the third story of the boy chums’
adventures.

This story of the boy chums’ adventures on and off the Florida Coast describes
many scenes of daring and adventure, in hunting for ships stranded and cargoes
washed ashore. The boy chums passed through many exciting scenes, their
conflicts with the Cuban wreckers; the loss of their vessel, the “Eager Quest,”
they will long remember. This is the fourth book of adventures which the boy
chums experienced.

dangerous quest for fortune. With their old and tried comrades, Captain Westfield
and the little negro, Chris, they join the great army of fishermen that
yearly search the Florida seas for the thousands of kinds of rare fish and water
creatures that abound there. The Florida waters hide many strange and unknown
dangers. The perils the chums encounter from weird fishes and creatures
of the sea and the menace of hurricanes and shipwreck, make very interesting
and instructive reading. This is the sixth book of adventures of the boy chums.

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
